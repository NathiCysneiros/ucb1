	abstract = {Research on sustainability and firm value has increased recently. However, there is little evidence in this context from ASEAN+3 (i.e., three major Asian economies [South Korea, Japan, and China] and six dynamic economies in the ASEAN region [Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam]). Therefore, this study explores the impact of sustainability reporting quality on firm value in the ASEAN+3 context. The study also explores the moderating role of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices, board gender diversity, board size, and the number of board meetings on the “sustainability reporting quality—firm value nexus.” Data collected from Thomson Reuters Asset4 with a sample size of 923 firms during the period 2019–2023 (4615 firm-year observations). Regression analysis techniques used include pooled ordinary least squares, fixed effects, and random effects models. The analysis results show new and unique discoveries from ASEAN+3. First, sustainability reporting quality has a positive impact on firm value. Second, ESG practices negatively moderate the “sustainability reporting quality—firm value nexus.” Third, the higher number of board members reduces the “sustainability reporting quality—firm value nexus”; however, the negative level of major economies is lower than that of ASEAN countries. Finally, the firm with more independent female directors strengthens the “sustainability reporting quality—firm value nexus.” This study enriches signaling theory and agency theory by highlighting the complex relationship between components and firm value. To enhance firm value within ASEAN+3, policymakers should prioritize standardized ESG reporting regulations and transparent communication channels; stakeholders must hold managers accountable for genuine ESG implementation and high-quality reporting; and businesses should prioritize board diversity, particularly independent female directors, alongside sustainability training. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Using the board gender diversity (BGD) reforms implemented in countries worldwide and a staggered difference-in-differences research design, this study highlights a significant positive impact of BGD reform on firms'CSR performance. Furthermore, the results reveal that among countries implementing BGD reforms, the effect of reform on CSR is more pronounced in countries with greater equality between men and women, as well as in nations with greater environmental, social, and governance risk concerns. Conversely, we observe a weaker influence of BGD on CSR in countries with stricter legal environments and greater political stability. Our findings also indicate that the implementation of BGD reform weakens the positive correlation between a firm's CSR performance and their future financial performance. In summary, these findings support the notion that while BGD reform plays a pivotal role in promoting firms’ CSR investment, improved CSR initiatives in a country after BGD reform implementation may yield less value enhancement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

This article investigates the correlation between environmental performance as a non-financial metric and financial performance. Simultaneously, it identifies the categories of environmental information provided by companies and the implicit responsibility with which they address environmental protection issues. Data were collected from the sustainability reports of 668 companies in Romania for the 2019–2021 period. The study uses, on the one hand, a diagnostic analysis method (the grid method) to determine the environmental performance (environmental score) of the companies. On the other hand, it uses a linear regression model to test the correlation between environmental performance and financial performance (including a tolerance analysis to identify multicollinearity, forward variable selection, backward variable selection, and the Durbin-Watson test). The study’s findings underscore a positive correlation between environmental non-financial performance and financial performance. In particular, high turnover and advanced age of the company are associated with high non-financial performance. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The global economy was profoundly impacted by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the hotel industry being among the sectors most severely affected. This study explores the relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and financial performance during the pandemic, focusing on 35 of the world’s largest hotel companies. A structured methodology was employed to assess short-term financial resilience using the shock depth (SD) and recovery rate (RR) indicators and long-term performance through the value-added weekly index (VAWI) and K-ratio. The findings of this study indicated that faster recovery was associated with greater capitalization. Furthermore, analysis of ESG scores indicated a median increase from 2019 to 2022, particularly in the figures of the environmental component. Despite these increases, pre-pandemic ESG scores demonstrated limited influence on short-term financial performance, though a correlation was observed between governance scores (as ESG score subscores) and long-term K-ratios. This finding suggests potential trade-offs between improving financial performance and maintaining governance standards in the sense of ESG scores. This study points to the intricate interplay between ESG and financial metrics during systemic crises, providing valuable insights for risk management and strategic planning in the hospitality business. The implications of these findings extend to the enhancement of resilience and the alignment of ESG strategies with financial sustainability. © 2025 by the authors.},

Using 10 years of panel data across resource-intensive, consumer-facing, and service sectors, the analysis employs the system generalized method of moments (GMM) for robust estimation. The results reveal a positive overall effect of ESG practices on ROA, with significant differences across industries. The study uses the categorization of resource-intensive, consumer-facing, and service industries to examine the differential effects of ESG factors on ROA. However, environmental scores do not significantly impact ROA, suggesting uniform effects across industries. Social scores enhance ROA without notable industry-specific differences, while governance scores show varying effects, indicating sector-specific drivers of profitability. The analysis also highlights the moderating effects of industry categories on the ESG–ROA relationship, suggesting that the impact of ESG practices varies across different sectors. The study also considers the economic effects of COVID-19, highlighting its marginal impact on ROA and the need for resilient financial strategies. However, the moderating effect of COVID-19 on this relationship was not significant, indicating limited variation in the ESG–ROA dynamics during the pandemic period except in the governance model. These findings suggest that tailored ESG strategies, aligned with industry-specific challenges, can optimize financial performance. Policymakers and investors are encouraged to focus on sector-specific ESG practices to better evaluate company performance and formulate effective regulations. This research contributes to the emerging market context by emphasizing the importance of industry-specific ESG integration for enhancing financial outcomes. © 2025 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

These return patterns are more pronounced among firms located in states with Democratic state governments and in regions with high levels of social trust where stakeholders are more attentive to CER. Additionally, we examine the relationship between CER and corporate financial performance, and find that firms with strong CER policies tend to have a higher level of revenue, profitability, and ownership held by institutional investors with longer investment horizons.

	abstract = {Purpose: This research aims to investigate the relationship between environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and the performance of real estate companies before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. By conducting a comprehensive case study analysis, we will explore how real estate companies' adoption of ESG practices has influenced their financial performance, market value and resilience during these uncertain times. The findings of this study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge on the relationship between ESG factors and company performance, specifically within the real estate sector. Moreover, the research outcomes will offer practical implications for real estate companies, investors, policymakers and other stakeholders, aiding them in making informed decisions regarding ESG integration and its potential benefits in uncertain times. Overall, this research aims to shed light on whether ESG factors truly enhance the performance of real estate companies, considering the unique challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and sanctions. By examining the case study before and during uncertain times including COVID-19 pandemic and sanctions, we provide valuable insights into the role of ESG practices in shaping the future of the real estate industry. Design/methodology/approach: The study focuses on the selection process and main model used to investigate the relationship between ESG factors and firm performance. The data is divided into four groups based on ESG quartiles to analyze differences between firms with high and low ESG scores. The Difference-in-Differences (DID) model is employed to assess anomalous returns and stock volatility across different ESG quartiles before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Panel data models are utilized to study the association between ESG and firm performance, with random effects and fixed effects estimators considered. The study builds a model to analyze the impact of ESG on financial performance indicators, incorporating various factors and control variables. Additionally, the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATET) analysis and DID model are explored to evaluate the causal impact of ESG on firm performance. The study emphasizes the importance of testing for parallel trends to ensure the validity of the ATET analysis and it presents a generalized DID model to examine the relationship between ESG scores and company performance outcomes. Findings: Our study's main conclusions show that, in a world with some degree of stability, ESG not only does not improve but, in some situations, also hurts firms' success. On the other hand, at times of notable worldwide unrest, like the COVID-19 pandemic, firms with better ESG ratings demonstrate exceptional stock market success and a noteworthy ability to rebound from a crisis. Moreover, we note that investors truly prioritize sustainable investments as a risk mitigation strategy in addition to their environmental and social duties only when companies face sufficiently significant risks. The results will highlight the significance of sustainable and responsible investment for investors and provide management with more knowledge to create effective ESG strategies for their companies. Practical implications: By incorporating sustainability and responsibility into their operations, businesses may reduce risk, perform better over the long run and benefit society and the environment. As investors come to understand the importance of ESG issues in their decision-making, the global landscape is experiencing a transformation. Therefore, in the era when stakeholders, such as consumers, workers and shareholders, want more responsibility and transparency when it comes to ESG practises, it is crucial that companies should devote their priority to their ESG performance in order to reduce the danger of slipping behind, especially in light of the increasing importance of sustainability issues and changing laws. However, in the case of small-sized firms, investment policies to improve companies’ governance need to be controlled in moderation during the period of stability because it will create financial pressure and leave them without enough resources to cope with negative impacts during uncertain period. In sum, sustainable and ethical investment is not only a fad; rather, it is a vital and unavoidable route for companies looking to prosper in an unpredictable and complicated global environment. Originality/value: This research study significantly enhances the existing academic discourse surrounding the relationship between ESG factors and firm performance, particularly, in periods of uncertainty. The findings underscore the critical importance for real estate companies to place a greater emphasis on ESG practices in order to not only benefit themselves but also to improve their overall performance and sustainability in the long term. By shedding light on the positive outcomes associated with prioritizing ESG considerations, this study offers valuable insights for real estate firms seeking to enhance their competitive advantage and stakeholder value in today's dynamic business landscape. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The methodology consists of a two-fold approach: first, cross-sectional FGLS regression with generalised least squares; second, overall interlinkages between considered variables through Bayesian network analysis. The research questions focus on the implications of each ESG pillar – environmental, social, and governance – on the performance of agricultural companies. Key findings entail that the environmental dimension strongly relates to agricultural companies’ outcomes, such as toxic chemicals reduction strategies, waste recycled to the total waste contribution, biodiversity impact reduction, and eco-design products. As regards the social pillar of ESG, salaries and wages positively relate only to shareholders’ earnings, while governance factors like CEO compensation, board structure type, and board’s gender diversity favourably influence the financial performance of agricultural companies. ESG implications for agricultural companies are beneficial when they implement sustainable strategies. These strategies include establishing targets for water efficiency policies, increasing employee turnover, maintaining a steadfast water efficiency policy, enhancing the use of environmentally-friendly products, and reevaluating board structures from unitary to two-tier or mixed types. © 2024 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study explores the relationship between retail investor attention and corporate environment, society, and governance (ESG) greenwashing. We demonstrate that greater retail investor attention drives greenwashing behaviors. This is confirmed through robust empirical analyses, including alternative definitions of greenwashing and retail investor attention, controls for confounding variables, quantile regressions, and Oster analysis. To address endogeneity, we employ an exogenous shock—initiation of online interactions via the SSE and SZSE e-interaction platforms—and prove a causal link between increased retail investor attention and prevalence of greenwashing practices. Regarding the underlying mechanisms, retail investor attention enables corporations to increase ESG disclosures but not actual ESG performance, and this effect is stronger in companies with higher financial constraints and are less managerial forward-looking. Additionally, better corporate governance and more professional investor attention reduce the influence of retail investors. Finally, we find that firms engaged in greenwashing tend to temporarily improve their financial performance. This study not only sheds light on the dynamics of retail investors' influence on corporate behavior but also underscores the need for professional investors and accountable corporate governance to mitigate the tendency towards greenwashing. © 2024},

We find that only cross-listed firms experience a favorable stock market response to improved ESG performance, particularly when signaling their commitment by listing in a developed market. However, they do not gain operational benefits from ESG activities, unlike non-cross-listed firms, possibly due to bonding costs. Additionally, industry type moderates the ESG-CFP relationship, with consumer goods and financial sectors showing positive market responses, while consumer services and technology sectors benefit in operational performance. Chinese firms exhibit limited gains from ESG efforts. Excluding Chinese firms reveals a negative ESG-CFP relationship in the healthcare sector. Overall, our study provides insights into the complex interplay among ESG, CFP, cross-listing, and industry characteristics, contributing to both theoretical understanding and practical implications for stakeholders. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Green innovation plays a crucial role in sustainable development, yet its financial impact on high-pollution industries remains underexplored. This study analyzes the short- and long-term financial effects of green innovation using 30,108 firm-year observations from Chinese A-share listed companies in high-pollution industries (2009–2022). Employing fixed-effects regression models, green innovation is measured through environmental patents (EnvrPats) and environmentally innovative patents (EnvrInvPats), with Return on Assets (ROA) as the financial performance metric. To address endogeneity concerns, instrumental variable (IV) techniques are applied using digital transformation (DT) as an instrument, alongside a two-stage Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach for validation. This study explores the moderating roles of Sustainable Liquidity Reserves (cash flow) and the Sustainable Development Index (ESG performance), while a channel test examines the influence of R&D expenditures and financial constraints. A heterogeneity analysis reveals that firms in high-pollution industries experience greater short-term financial benefits from green innovation, driven by regulatory pressures and public scrutiny. A pre- and post-COVID-19 analysis highlights the increased importance of green innovation in firm resilience during economic disruptions. Robustness checks, including alternative financial performance measures and nonlinear modeling, confirm the reliability of the findings. While green innovation imposes initial financial costs, firms with stronger cash reserves and ESG performance can better absorb these costs and achieve long-term financial gains, emphasizing the need for targeted policy support to facilitate sustainable growth. © 2025 by the authors.},

Our findings reveal a negative effect of ESG risk scores on financial performance measures, indicating that higher ESG risks hinder firm performance measured by ROE and ROIC. Furthermore, both the size and independence of the board decrease corporate performance in Saudi firms. Family-controlled ownership structures often limit the effectiveness of independent directors in enhancing performance. In Saudi firms, women’s board participation shows an insignificant impact on corporate performance, suggesting that the Tokenism Theory may apply.

Design/methodology/approach: Dynamic panel data regressions are used to analyze a sample of 114 companies listed on the Latin American Integrated Market, MILA (Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru) for the period 2011–2020. The Altman Z-score and Piotroski F-score are used as indicators of the probability of default and comprehensive financial strength. Models are developed in which the relationship between economic value added (EVA) and Jensen’s alpha are evaluated against firms’ ESG practices. Findings: A direct relationship between ESG strategies and financial performance was found. Better practices and transparency in ESG are related to lower probability of bankruptcy, greater financial strength, greater EVA and superior risk-adjusted returns. Research limitations/implications: ESG data were obtained from the Bloomberg system based on a methodology that may differ from other sources. The sample covers four Latin American countries and large corporations. Independent variables were selected for their perceived validity, given their frequent use in previous studies. Practical implications: Evidence for company management regarding the importance of strengthening ESG practices and reporting should be part of their balanced scorecards. For investors, the results support the importance of evaluating ESG practices in asset selection. Originality/value: The present study is the first research to present empirical evidence on the relationship between ESG scores and disclosures for MILA countries, using a comprehensive set of financial performance indicators (Altman Z-scores, Piotroski F-scores, EVA and Jensen’s alpha). © 2024, Alejandro J.

The results are weaker for stores in counties with more diverse populations. We also find that total spending, spending per transaction, and spending per customer decrease after firms speak out. Our results are attributed to a decrease in traffic from less frequent customers who spend less time shopping but offset by customers who increase their shopping time. Consistent with offsetting effects, we do not find evidence that speaking out is associated with changes in firm-level financial performance or an equity market response.

Moreover, the moderating effect of institutional quality on this relationship has not been examined. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the nonlinear impact of ESG performance on the financial performance of insurance companies in the MENAT region, as well as the moderating effect of institutional quality. To achieve this, a sample of 31 insurance companies located in the seven MENAT countries was constructed over the period 2017–2022. The sample was selected based on the completeness and availability of ESG-related data. This ensured a standardized dataset to enhance the reliability of the results. To estimate this relationship, the System Generalized Method of Moments (SGMM) was used. This technique was used to address endogeneity issues. The empirical results indicate that the performance of the insurance companies is better for those with better ESG performance. Moreover, the quality of institutions is an even more important factor in enhancing the ESG practices–corporate performance nexus. More in-depth analysis is needed to show how these various relationships might be altered with ESG criteria. The findings of this research would, therefore, be beneficial to insurers in terms of an increased understanding of how effective integration of ESG practices, both at the institutional and company level, could be streamlined to enhance their long-term competitiveness and profitability. © 2025 by the author.},

Investment portfolios constructed based on ESG risk levels consistently outperformed benchmarks during periods of economic instability, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating the resilience of firms with effective ESG management. From an investor's perspective, tailored and valid ESG disclosures are essential for informed decision-making. This study extends the signalling governance theory by identifying low ESG risk—particularly governance risk—as a direct signal of corporate resilience and sustainability. It underscores the strategic importance of governance improvements and customised ESG frameworks in enhancing financial outcomes, investment performance, and stakeholder trust. It offers actionable insights for ICT firms navigating increasingly uncertain global markets. © 2025},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims at examining the contentions of the agency theory by exploring the direct relationship between environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure score and corporate financial performance (CFP) from the years 2016–2020. It also tests for the adaptability of slack resources theory by testing this relationship in the presence of a moderating variable (financial slack). Design/methodology/approach: The study relies on the data obtained from Bloomberg database of 112 companies belonging to different sectors. It employs the use of partial least square structure equation modelling (PLS-SEM) for carrying out the empirical analysis. Findings: The results obtained show that there exists a negative relationship between ESG and CFP of the sample firms. These results lend support to the propositions of both the agency theory. Further, the financial slack in the organizations does not ensure a firm's responsible behavior. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides important implications both from the perspective of managers as well as policymakers. The results of this study will aid the managers in reducing the instances of information asymmetry in the market, thereby tackling the issue of principle agent problems within an organization. From the policy marking perspective, the results of this study will help the regulatory authorities in implementing the necessary rules, regulations and laws that will ensure increased participation from the corporate sector in disclosing their sustainability-related information. Originality/value: This study is one of its kind to explore the impact of a moderating variable on the ESG-CFP relationship in the context of an emerging economy. It also contributes to the present stream of literature by providing both a theoretical and empirical support to the propositions under consideration. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Supporting our hypotheses, we find that spells of extreme high temperature have a curvilinear impact on financial performance. While extreme high temperature spells tend to degrade financial performance in regions or months with normally hotter conditions, the opposite effect is observed for extreme high temperature spells in regions or months with normally cooler conditions. Given our environmental context, where the standard temperature is about 16°C, high temperature spells with maximums that well exceed that temperature have marked financial implications. We also find that spells in locations with maximum temperatures above 23°C associate with smaller improvements in ESG scores and higher carbon emissions in the future, suggesting that managers’ actions to mitigate the risks of high temperature spells are limited at best. Our evidence of significant impacts of extreme temperature on firm performance but little action in response supports the view that managers need more guidance on how to measure the risks and opportunities of extreme weather events and the policies to manage them. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: The banking industry faces increasing scrutiny from stakeholders regarding its environmental and social impacts, given its crucial role in fostering economic growth. Banks have been encouraged to adopt environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices to mitigate risks and safeguard their reputation. However, the effectiveness of ESG sensitivity within the banking industry is contingent upon ownership and structural factors. The extent to which banks can integrate ESG considerations into their operations and decision-making processes may vary based on their ownership structures. Therefore, this study aims to examine if the impact of ESG on the performance of Indian banks varies between private and public sector banks. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs six years of panel data from two separate samples of 12 private sector banks and 10 public sector banks in India. It utilises fixed and random effect estimation techniques with robust standard errors to derive accurate and reliable econometric results. Findings: The main findings of this study reveal intriguing insights into the relationship between ESG factors and bank performance, considering the influence of ownership structure. For private sector banks, the ESG composite score, particularly the social dimension, negatively impacts financial performance. However, there is a contrasting positive effect on efficiency. In contrast, public sector banks demonstrate a positive and significant association between the environmental score and return on equity and non-performing assets. Practical implications: The findings highlight the need for tailored strategies that align with ownership structure to achieve sustainable financial and societal outcomes in the banking industry. Furthermore, it emphasises the need for private-sector banks to streamline their ESG initiatives, especially in the social dimension, to mitigate negative impacts on their financial performance. Originality/value: This study introduces a novel dimension by addressing the “one size fits all” bias in prior research that overlooked bank ownership differences when examining the impact of ESG factors on bank performance. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

ESG scores are calculated using an enormous number of variables related to the sustainability practices of firms; thus, it is impractical for investors to come up with predictions of ESG performance. This paper aims to fill this gap by using only the past score-based and rating-based ESG performance as the determinant of future ESG performance using four machine learning-based algorithms; decision tree (DT), random-forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and logistic regression (LR). The proposed model is validated in BIST sustainability index companies. The results suggest that past ESG grade-based and numerical scores can be used as a determinant of future ESG performance. The results prove that a simple indicator could serve to predict future ESG scores rather than complex data alternatives. Using data from BIST sustainability index companies in Turkey, the findings demonstrate that past ESG grades and scores are reliable predictors of future ESG performance, offering a simple yet effective alternative to complex data-driven methods. This study not only contributes to advancing sustainable finance practices but also provides practical tools for emerging markets like Turkey to align corporate strategies with global sustainability standards. The methodological contributions also have broader relevance for international financial markets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Data on financial performance and environmental impacts before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic of 22 entities from 2019 to 2022 were used for the analysis. This study is structured around three major points. First, the regression analyses identify a clear range of turning points (between JPY 0.818 and 0.922) that the 22 corporations should target in terms of scope 1 carbon dioxide emissions per employee and total shareholders return per employee (TSR/EMP) based on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Second, the EKC hypothesis is established based on the deciding factors that result from the interaction of (1) enforcement of stricter emissions regulations, including penalties; (2) business and environmental organizations’ guidelines, ratings, and initiatives; (3) investors’ emphasis on the environment, social, and governance (ESG) concept; and (4) intrinsic or endogenous efforts of the corporations. These four points have been recently encouraged and prioritized in Japan. Third, an approach that focuses on ESG and TSR can contribute not only to the achievement of financial growth and environmental conservation but also to the expansion of the academic literature. © 2025, Econjournals.

Design/methodology/approach: Fixed effect regressions with robust standard errors for unbalanced panel data are used to investigate the impact of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosure scores and carbon emissions intensity on firm profitability. The authors used simultaneous quantile regressions with bootstrapped standard errors to allow for estimating parameters of different quantiles of superior and inferior financial performers. Non-linear regressions are used to test for curvilinear relationships. Two-stage least squares regressions are used to mitigate concerns of endogeneity. Findings: The results reveal that firms with less emissions of carbon dioxide report high profitability, however, firms with high ESG disclosure scores do not achieve superior performance. The authors detect a positive curvilinear U-shaped relationship and determine threshold level of ESG scores. Furthermore, firms with sustainable investments have more resilient performance during COVID-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications: A comprehensive analysis of the complex effect of environmental sustainability on financial performance in emerging markets uncovers the strategic motivations behind ESG disclosures and the thresholds where environmental performance translates into financial gains. Overall, this study emphasises the significance of sustainable investments in enhancing long-term profitability and resilience in emerging markets during turbulent times. Practical implications: Proactive carbon emission reduction strategies are essential to safeguard firm competitive advantage. Firm ESG investments should be considered when forecasting firm value and stock price. There is a growing need for rigid policies to promote a green economy and mitigate climate change risks.

This study uses the Climate Resilient City Construction (CRCC) to represent China's regional climate change action. It uses data from Chinese listed companies from 2013 to 2020 to determine how the CRCC affects corporate ESG performance. The results show that the CRCC can significantly improve corporate ESG performance. In addition, institutional investor shareholding and board diversity can effectively enhance the positive impact of the CRCC on corporate ESG performance. Mechanism analysis shows that the CRCC can increase government financial incentives and corporate green innovation, stimulating firms to improve ESG performance. Finally, the results of heterogeneity analysis show that the CRCC has a more substantial impact on firms located in regions with more severe climate hazards, higher GHG concentrations, and temperate monsoon climate zones, as well as those with a lack of political connections and a higher degree of digital transformation. This study reveals how the CRCC improves corporate ESG performance through theoretical analysis and measures the marginal impact of the CRCC on f corporate ESG performance through empirical analysis. These new findings provide suggestions for policymakers and market participants to address climate change. © 2025 The Authors},

The results from the regression analysis reveal that blockchain adoption is significantly and positively associated with two sub-dimensions of environmental sustainability performance: resource usage and emissions. Additionally, firms exhibiting higher profitability and greater financial leverage appear to more effectively control blockchain adoption to enhance their corporate sustainability performance.

The financial sector, exerting significant influence over the economy, is essential for sustaining economic stability via the lending mechanism. Our study focuses on examining the influence of ESG factors on the financial stability of European financial institutions. To attain this goal, we utilized fixed-effects and random-effects dynamic panel models, analyzing 352 financial institutions across many European nations from 2019 to 2021. The study’s findings reveal a complex scenario. The findings indicate that ethical and corporate responsibility practices significantly impact the financial performance of European financial institutions. Nonetheless, the execution of policies pertaining to ESG ethics seems markedly inadequate. Our research reveals substantial evidence of a direct correlation between ethical practices and profit stability, diverging from other studies. This newly established group directly influences the financial performance of financial institutions in Europe. These findings enhance the comprehension of the interaction between ESG variables and financial stability, illuminating both the beneficial effects and the current deficiencies in ethical behaviors within the European banking sector. © 2025 by the authors.},

Analyzing data from 72 companies over the period of 2018 to 2022, and employing a fixed effects model with cluster robust errors, the study reveals that firms underperforming relative to their financial aspirations tend to reduce ESG transparency.

We find that ESG activities have a significant positive impact on the company's both accounting and market-based measures of performance. In addition, governance and social activities have a positive significant effect on FP. However, environmental activities and disclosure were negatively and significantly associated with FP. The study provides novel insights by describing the nuanced financial trade-offs of ESG practices in a highly regulated and capital-intensive industry like health care. It contributes to the literature by emphasizing that although environmental investments may hinder short-term FP, strong governance and social activities remain essential drivers of sustainable performance in health care. The study provides empirical insights on how ESG practices impact FP in the health care industry and complements the available literature on the economic efficiency of ESG performance, particularly in FP.

By focusing on family firms (FFs), we deepen both the role of business ethics as a predictor of enhanced ESG engagement and the link with improved corporate financial performance (CFP). In this way, we aim to provide new insights into the impact of business ethics and ESG engagement on FFs competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a worldwide panel of 335 FFs covering the 2002–2020 time horizon, this study adopts a two-stage Heckman model (1979) to empirically address two research questions: (RQ1) Do business ethics predict greater ESG engagement in FFs? (RQ2) Does ESG engagement positively affect the corporate financial performance (CFP) of FFs? Findings: The results of the current study are twofold. First, we demonstrate that an ethical approach to business drives greater ESG engagement. Second, we show that higher levels of ESG engagement lead to improved financial performance in FFs. Originality/value: Our study contributes to filling the knowledge gaps regarding the drivers and effects of ESG engagement in FFs. On the one hand, we demonstrate the positive connection between dimensions that have their own identity, such as business ethics and ESG constructs. On the other hand, by shedding light on the impact of ESG engagement on improved CFP, we contribute to solving the trade-off between economic and noneconomic FF goals. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To this end, this study uses financial data and empirical panel data of Fortune 300 firms from 2008 to 2021 and firm-specific ESG scores derived from the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS) to conduct an empirical analysis. Specifically, a panel model analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between ESG management and firm performance using alternative variables on board characteristics. In the basic model analysis, we adopted alternative variables for ESG management and board characteristics and conducted a panel model analysis to examine the relationship between these factors and corporate performance. In the basic model analysis that included board characteristics, only board size (+) and nationality diversity (−) had a statistically significant effect on corporate performance, while gender diversity had no statistically significant effect on corporate performance. However, in the full model analysis, where board characteristics and ESG management were combined, factors E (−) and S (+) had statistically significant effects on firm performance, confirming that the presence of a board of directors leads to better performance. We found that the effects of E and S on firm performance were reversed, indicating that there is a difference in the cost of ESG management by factor. Finally, G did not have a statistically significant relationship with firm performance, which was likely due to the fact that the characteristics of the board were already reflected in ESG, confirming the role of the board. As a result, the board of directors seems to help with the smooth implementation of ESG management by focusing on internal stabilization and communication, suggesting that future research should consider the impact of the board of directors rather than analyzing ESG management in isolation. The results also show that the board of directors in the G sector has a significant impact on ESG management, but it is not treated as an important factor in ESG evaluation criteria, suggesting that it is necessary to reflect factors on stakeholder communication. Finally, the practical implication is that a united board is necessary to implement ESG management in corporate operations. © 2025 by the authors.},

The findings of two-step system Generalized Method of Moment indicate a negative correlation between ESG investments and CDF, suggesting that increased ESG commitments may initially restrict access to debt financing. Nonetheless, FSD serves as an important moderating variable, converting this adverse effect into a favorable one. A strong financial sector offers substantial funds under relaxed terms.

Despite the increasing implementation of green credit policies, their impact on corporate risk-taking remains underexplored in the existing literature. This study investigates the effects and underlying mechanisms of green credit policies on risk-taking behaviors among Chinese listed companies from 2009 to 2019. Utilizing econometric methodologies, including Difference-in-Differences, mediation analysis, and moderation analysis, the findings reveal that green credit policies significantly enhance the risk-taking activities of polluting enterprises. These results are robust across various sensitivity tests. Additionally, the relationship between green credit policies and corporate risk-taking is mediated by debt maturity mismatch and moderated by ESG and executive compensation. Subgroup analyses indicate that large and state-owned polluting enterprises experience greater increases in risk-taking compared to their small, medium-sized, and private counterparts. Furthermore, executive remuneration notably amplifies risk-taking in private firms.

The sample includes 912 funds, categorized by their ESG ratings (AAA to CCC), using MSCI ratings as the classification metric. The performance evaluation uses risk-adjusted measures such as the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio and Jensen’s alpha, along with an assessment of market timing capabilities based on an extended four-factor model. Findings: The results show that mutual funds with higher ESG ratings consistently outperform their lower-rated peers in both absolute and risk-adjusted returns. These funds also exhibit superior market timing abilities. ESG-aligned funds not only provide a favorable risk-return profile but also enhance the appeal of responsible investment strategies, particularly within the volatile and innovation-driven technology sector. The study reinforces the notion that ESG factors contribute positively to long-term value creation for investors. Practical implications: The findings are valuable for investors and policymakers aiming to incorporate ESG factors into investment strategies, especially in sectors characterized by rapid technological advancements. The superior performance of ESG-compliant funds highlights the importance of sustainable investing and its potential to align financial returns with broader environmental and social goals. Originality/value: This study adds to the growing body of literature on ESG investing by specifically focusing on tech-heavy mutual funds in the Eurozone. It offers new insights into how ESG ratings at the fund level, rather than at the firm level, influence investment performance and market timing within the high-growth, high-risk technology sector. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Using a multiple linear regression model and a sample of 245 firms, the research examines how ESG and its components influence financial outcomes while controlling for market capitalization, company age, and R&D expenditure. The findings reveal that neither overall ESG nor individual Disclosure scores significantly affect ROA, ROE, or ROI. Notably, the Environmental Disclosure Score shows a negative but non-significant relationship with financial performance, while the Social and Governance Disclosure Scores also lack statistically significant effects. Conversely, market capitalization positively influences financial performance, and company age negatively impacts ROE and ROI. R&D expenditure does not significantly affect any financial performance measures. These results suggest that ESG disclosures in Post-Soviet EU States, may not yet be sufficiently developed to influence financial performance directly. The study underscores the importance of firm size in driving financial success in the region and emphasizes the need for further research into ESG factors in this context. © 2025, Econjournals.

Using a sample of 2079 Chinese public firms during 2018–2022, we aim to answer this question by empirically investigating how ESG rating divergence affects firms' green innovation efforts. Our empirical results reveal a robust negative impact of such divergence on firms' future green innovation patent applications. The two-stage regression results based on the instrumental variable approach confirm that the impact is causal. Further analyses indicate that divergent ESG ratings inhibit green innovation efforts by increasing firms' capital costs and information asymmetry. Consistent with this mechanism, we document that the inhibitory effect is more pronounced for firms with greater financial constraints, poorer information environments, or larger stock or financial performance pressures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

Investors and financial advisors are increasingly confronted with the crucial question of whether their dedication to ESG values enhances or hampers their pursuit of financial performance. Addressing this crucial issue, our research delves into the impact of ESG ratings on financial performance, exploring a cutting-edge machine learning approach powered by the Extreme Gradient algorithm. Our study centers on US-registered equity funds with a global investment scope, and performs a cross-sectional data analysis for annualized fund returns for a five-year period (2017–2021). To fortify our analysis, we synergistically amalgamate data from three prominent mutual fund databases, thereby bolstering data completeness, accuracy, and consistency. Through thorough examination, our findings substantiate the positive correlation between ESG ratings and fund performance. In fact, our investigation identifies ESG score as one of the dominant variables, ranking among the top five with the highest predictive capacity for mutual fund performance. As sustainable investing continues to ascend as a central force within financial markets, our study underscores the pivotal role that ESG factors play in shaping investment outcomes. Our research provides socially responsible investors and financial advisors with valuable insights, empowering them to make informed decisions that align their financial objectives with their commitment to ESG values. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses event study methodology on 412 listed firms to analyze market reactions around the announcement date. The sector-wise analysis further delves into variations across industries. Cross-sectional analysis explores the significance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores and firm controls in explaining the differences across sample firms. Findings: The event study reveals initial negative market reactions on the event day, with a subsequent shift from positive to negative cumulative impact, indicating the evolving nature of investor sentiment. The sector-wise analysis highlights heterogeneous effects, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies based on industry-specific characteristics. The cross-sectional findings underscore the growing importance of ESG factors, with firm size and performance influencing market reactions. Financial leverage and liquidity prove insufficient to explain cumulative abnormal return (CAR) differences, while past returns and volatility are influential technical factors. Practical implications: The economic significance of the results indicates a growing trend where investors prioritize companies with more substantial ESG scores, potentially driving shifts in corporate strategies toward sustainability. Better ESG performance signifies improved risk management and long-term resilience in the face of market dynamics.

By elucidating the relationship between ESG disclosure score and firm profitability, this study tried to provide useful insights for investors, policymakers, and corporate barons seeking to enhance long-term financial resilience and societal impact through responsible business practices. Design/Methodology/Approach: This study consisted of 254 non-financial listed companies of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) nations over the period from 2011 to 2023. Data were collected from Thomson Reuters’ Refinitiv Eikon database to analyze the impact of ESG disclosure scores on financial performance and market performance of firms. This was analyzed by applying different GMM methods. Findings : The research revealed a positively significant impact of ESG disclosure score on financial performance (measured by return on assets and return on equity), whereas there was a negatively significant impact on market performance (measured by closing price and Tobin’s Q). Originality/Value: Empirical evidence on the nexus between ESG disclosure score and firm performance from an emerging nation context was limited. This research provided firsthand evidence in the area of sustainability performance from BRICS nations, as these five economies represented over 41% of the world’s population, 24% of global gross domestic product (GDP), and 16% of world trade and exhibited impressive economic growth potential. © 2025, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Findings reveal industry-specific patterns: In sensitive industries, gender diversity negatively affects ESG scores in low- and medium-sustainability companies, while nationality diversity consistently improves ESG outcomes across all levels. In non-sensitive industries, age diversity enhances ESG scores in medium- and high-sustainability companies, whereas educational diversity shows mixed effects—negative in medium and positive in high-sustainability companies. Nationality diversity also positively impacts ESG outcomes in medium-sustainability companies.

This research aims to analyze empirical evidence of the Exploring the Financial Performance from ESG And Prosperity Disclosure Score. The research was conducted using causality design, while the samples of 84 companies listed on the IDX-IC (Indonesian Stock Exchange) for the 2019 – 2021 period were selected using certain criteria. Data analysis was carried out with balanced panel data regression. The results show that aggregate ESG & prosperity disclosure impaired the increasing returns on company assets. Individually, environmental and prosperity disclosure did not affect financial performance, while social and governance disclosures affect financial performance. The ESG and prosperity disclosures can undermine financial performance, in part because a focus on ESG initiatives can divert management’s attention from short-term financial goals to long- term sustainability goals. This causes management to prioritize goals aligned with sustainability and social responsibility over short-term financial gains. In this study, financial performance is measured using ROA. This ratio has a weakness in its use, namely that it does not take into account differences in the company’s capital structure, and depreciated fixed assets can affect ROA, providing a less accurate picture of actual financial performance. © 2025 Titik Aryati et al., published by Sciendo.},

Drawing upon empirical evidence from 105 listed companies within the semiconductor industry, we compare the differences in the roles of green and traditional technology innovations on firms' sustainable performance, concentrating on the operating mechanism and external circumstances of green technology innovation. Results show that both green and traditional technology innovation can enhance enterprises' sustainable performance, with the former exhibiting more significant effects. Meanwhile, green technology innovation indirectly enhances sustainable and environmental performance by improving environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings, without indirectly improving financial performance. Additionally, online public opinion attention moderates the effectiveness of green technology innovation in enhancing firms' sustainable and environmental performance.

	abstract = {Based on the perspective of systematic tail risk, this study aims to explore the impact of environmental social and governance (ESG) performance on financial performance. At the same time, it also explores the mediating effects of financing constraints, information transparency, and corporate reputation in this relationship. This study uses the data from Chinese A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2022 as samples, uses two-way fixed-effect regression to test the benchmark model and mechanism model, and conducts a series of robustness tests and heterogeneity tests. The findings show that the following: (1) ESG performance significantly reduces systematic tail risk, with individual tail risk driving this negative relationship. (2) ESG performance lowers systematic tail risk through alleviating financing constraints, improving information transparency, and enhancing corporate reputation. (3) The inhibitory effect of ESG on systematic tail risk is more pronounced in the non-state-owned, low-pollution, high-liquidity, and high-information-efficiency samples. (4) Among the three dimensions of ESG, governance (G) has the most substantial impact in reducing systematic tail risk, compared to environmental (E) and social (S). This study is the first to explore the role of ESG performance on financial performance from the perspective of systematic tai risk. At the same time, we discuss for the first time how ESG performance affects tail system risk. This study contributes to an in-depth exploration of ESG’s role in financial performance, providing insights for preventing financial risk and achieving sustainable development. © 2025 by the authors.},

This study compares the financial resilience (measured by financial performance) of EMNEs with corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities with EMNEs without CSR activities, as well as how local companies changed before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Using panel data from 404 publicly listed Brazilian companies between 2018 and 2021, this study reveals that an uncertain institutional environment can lead EMNEs to increase non-market strategies and develop distinct firm-specific advantages via CSR. Our findings contribute to the literature by supporting the relevance of CSR activities at home to reduce the liability of origin and to provide global legitimation to EMNEs. Furthermore, it highlights the positive connection between CSR and financial resilience and the role of environmental, social, and governance (ESG)-driven investors in advocating for better governance, which ultimately enhances financial resilience. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.},

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses event study methodology on 412 listed firms to analyze market reactions around the announcement date. The sector-wise analysis further delves into variations across industries. Cross-sectional analysis explores the significance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores and firm controls in explaining the differences across sample firms. Findings: The event study reveals initial negative market reactions on the event day, with a subsequent shift from positive to negative cumulative impact, indicating the evolving nature of investor sentiment. The sector-wise analysis highlights heterogeneous effects, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies based on industry-specific characteristics. The cross-sectional findings underscore the growing importance of ESG factors, with firm size and performance influencing market reactions. Financial leverage and liquidity prove insufficient to explain cumulative abnormal return (CAR) differences, while past returns and volatility are influential technical factors. Practical implications: The economic significance of the results indicates a growing trend where investors prioritize companies with more substantial ESG scores, potentially driving shifts in corporate strategies toward sustainability. Better ESG performance signifies improved risk management and long-term resilience in the face of market dynamics. Regulatory bodies may respond by enhancing ESG reporting requirements, while financial institutions integrate ESG factors into their models, emphasizing the benefits of sustainability and financial performance.

The analysis, rooted in the context of the Paris Agreement and sustainable finance, employs a comprehensive dataset of the top 512 listed Indian companies from 2012 to 2023. Our findings reveal that high ESG scores significantly bolster company resilience during financial distress, highlighting the dual benefits of sustainable practices on corporate stability and environmental impact. Additionally, the paper underscores the pivotal role of wavelet analysis in capturing the multifaceted effects of ESG scores across various industries and financial distress quantiles, thereby offering a more nuanced understanding of ESG impacts. These insights not only contribute to the academic discourse on sustainable finance but also offer practical implications for policymakers and corporate strategists aiming to align financial performance with sustainable development goals (SDGs). ESG scores at which financial distress no longer negatively affects the firm's value are provided. These ESG scores range between 33.153 and 33.456 and are driven by the median of the conditional distribution of the firm's value. Policy implications are discussed. © 2025 The Author(s).

By systematically identifying ESG discussions, the framework discovers that ESG themes are prevalent and evolve over time, reflecting corporate priorities and external pressures. ESG content was extracted using the Refinitiv-Sustainable Leadership Monitor's framework and summarized through Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based summarization and topic modeling employed for clustering and trend analysis. The results indicate that ESG-related topics are influenced by global events and are closely correlated with the S&P 500 ESG index. Additionally, a similarity matrix analysis highlights the strong interconnection between ESG elements and corporate performance, particularly in financial management and social responsibility. Causality analysis further demonstrates that social factors significantly impact the S&P 500 ESG index, suggesting that companies prioritizing social responsibility, transparency, and communication can improve both their ESG scores and financial performance.

This paper examines the role of sustainable business in reducing and limiting global CO2 concentrations based on daily CO2 data from the Mauna Loa Observatory. Based on the theory of the carbon cycle, factors considered significant in determining global CO2 concentrations include emissions, affected by economic variables like the crude oil price and Dow Jones Sustainability Index but also absorption capacity, affected through biomass growth by astronomical variables such as total solar irradiance and cosmic rays. Considering pair-wise correlations between variables, particular attention is drawn to the fact that in the COVID-19 pandemic, when everyone was working from home, cars were not allowed on the roads, and planes were not flying, the correlation between the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the global CO2 concentration was negative. The article tests the hypothesis that business can be a force for good and make a meaningful contribution towards reducing global CO2 concentrations. To this end, it offers an integrated model of global CO2 concentrations built according to the theory of the carbon cycle based on 2195 daily observations, including all the variables outlined above. The results confirm the hypothesis that business, expressed in the form of Dow Jones Sustainability Index, can play a role in reducing the global CO2 concentrations.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether banks’ environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities impact their profitability and stability. The authors also explore whether banking industry competition and the country’s regulatory quality moderate the impact of banks’ ESG on their profitability and stability. Design/methodology/approach: The sample includes data from 46 banks in 11 Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) from 2010 to 2020. The authors have used the generalized method of moments (GMM) as the primary estimation model, with robustness tests to validate research findings. Findings: The results show that neither ESG nor its components impact bank profitability. Instead, ESG and its social component decrease bank stability. The findings neither support the stakeholder theory nor the risk-management view, which proposes that ESG activities improve financial performance and reduce unnecessary risks. However, an increase in market power (reduced competition) frees resources for banks, such that they focus more on ESG activities, which improves profitability, albeit at reduced stability levels. This finding supports the competition-related differentiation hypothesis. Finally, a country’s regulatory quality change does not influence bank ESG to impact its profitability or stability. This finding does not support the institutions-ESG proposition. Research limitations/implications: This study has several limitations. First, constrained by data availability, the authors could not examine Islamic banks in OIC countries. Examining the ESG outcomes in Islamic banks would be interesting based on Islamic ethics and corporate social responsibility perspectives. The data set could also be more recent so that the differential impact of COVID-19 on bank ESG and financial performance could be estimated. The coverage of OIC countries was limited in our sample; this could be improved in future research. Practical implications: Banks should evaluate the focus and scope of their ESG activities, communicate their long-term strategic benefits with stakeholders and align ESG with their strategy and business model to offer innovative ESG-based products. They should also recalibrate ESG in their risk management framework to catalyse stability and stakeholders’ trust. Policymakers should control the level of competition so banks can foster ESG without sacrificing financial performance. Also, banks should be given regulatory incentives so ESG becomes integral to bank growth, direction and stability. Social implications: ESG should be part of banks’ strategy and business model, to maximize its benefits for stakeholders, while maintaining competition and providing regulatory incentives. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the influence of bank ESG activities on their profitability and stability in OIC countries. The authors also extend the theoretical literature by connecting competition and regulatory quality to ESG-led financial performance. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Additionally, we examine the conditional effect of industry profile (heavy industry vs. light industry) and percentage of board independence. We employed panel regression method for data analysis. Our results indicate a positive and significant relationship between ESG disclosure and firm performance. Overall, we found that a higher ESG disclosure score is associated with improved firm performance across all four performance indicators. When considering individual components of ESG disclosure, we observed that governance disclosure score exhibited a positive and significant relationship with all four indicators of firm performance. On the other hand, environment and social disclosure scores showed a positive and significant relationship only with operational performance and market performance. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that industry profile moderates the relationship between ESG disclosure score and firm performance indicators. Specifically, it affects operational performance, and market performance. The moderating effect of board independence also significantly moderated the relationship. Specifically, board independence influences the relationship with operational, accounting and market performance concerning governance disclosure score, whereas for environment and social disclosure scores, it only influenced accounting and financial performance. Our findings offer a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between ESG disclosure and firm performance, considering various performance indicators and the influence of industry profile and board independence. These insights contribute significantly to both theoretical understanding and practical applications in this field. © 2025},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of environmental disclosure and corporate governance on the financial performance of Islamic banks in Saudi Arabia. This study highlights that sustainable practices are transparent with financial objectives using the religious framework of Islamic finance. This research is based on Worldwide Vision 2030, which covers sustainable development and promotes environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles, as well as corporate governance factors, such as board composition and Shariah Supervisory Boards (SSBs). We use a hybrid approach for our findings, with a dataset spanning 2011–2023 for the quantitative analysis and 20 semi-structured analyses conducted for a qualitative approach that aligns with objectives. We found that environmental disclosure boosts profits and stakeholder trust. Corporate governance structures, such as environmental boards and sustainability committees, improve the environmental disclosure of financial performance in Islamic banks. In this positive interaction, specialized governance drives Sharia-compliant sustainability initiatives. SSBs help Islamic banks integrate sustainability and meet religious and ESG environmental standards. Board diversity and dedication in the sustainability committee both play important roles in enhancing environmental disclosure practices; in return, these improved financial performances. The interaction of environmental disclosure and board environmental expertise has a positive impact on the overall performance, which indicates that governance structure supports sustainability-related decision-making, aligning with transparency. This study suggests that Islamic banks standardize ESG frameworks, improve board environmental expertise, and invest in real-time sustainability reporting digital solutions. Saudi Islamic banks can lead regional and global sustainable banking by adopting these strategies to align with global sustainability trends, improve financial performance, and meet ethical finance expectations. © 2025 by the authors.},

This study aims to assess the comparative performance of Islamic banks across ASEAN, examine the relationship between Islamic conformity, profitability, and green banking practices, and compare performance indicators between Malaysian and Indonesian Islamic banks. The sample includes Islamic banks from Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, Thailand, and the Philippines. The findings reveal consistent adherence to Sharia principles across all banks, demonstrating strong Islamic conformity. However, financial performance indicators such as Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Net Profit Margin (NPM) show significant variability, reflecting differences in operational efficiency and profitability. Green banking practices positively correlate with profitability, particularly ROA and NPM, emphasizing the role of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives in enhancing operational efficiency and customer loyalty. The comparative analysis highlights that while both Malaysian and Indonesian Islamic banks exhibit consistent Islamic conformity, Malaysian banks outperform their Indonesian counterparts in green banking practices and profitability. This advantage is attributed to Malaysia’s advanced regulatory environment, which promotes sustainable finance, whereas Indonesian banks face greater profitability variability, necessitating improved governance and operational strategies. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders, showcasing how Islamic financial principles can integrate with sustainability practices to achieve profitability and environmental responsibility in Islamic banking. © Muhammad Alkindi, Wiwik Utami, 2025.},

Scholars debate whether family businesses prioritize short-term gains over long-term ESG issues or, due to their long-term focus, integrate ESG into their strategies. One group of scholars argues that family businesses tend to focus excessively on short-term financial performance, neglecting long-term non-financial performance. In contrast, another group contends that due to socioemotional wealth considerations, family businesses place particular emphasis on long-term non-financial performance. This study utilizes data from publicly listed companies in Taiwan to conduct relevant research. Furthermore, we incorporate external governance variables to examine their impact on environmental and social performance. The research data come from the TEJ database. The sample is the annual data of listed companies in Taiwan. The sample period covers 2015 to 2022, with a total of 4377 company-year observations. The study finds that the corporate governance mechanisms of family enterprises have a negative and significant impact on environmental and social performance. However, external governance factors, such as higher institutional investor shareholding ratios, third-party-verified sustainability reports, and corporate governance evaluations, help mitigate these negative effects. Future research could extend the study period and explore additional external governance variables or alternative datasets to enhance the robustness and generalizability of the findings. © 2025 by the authors.},

Using financial indicators such as ROA, ROE, and ROI, the research challenges the belief that sustainability drives financial success and mitigates risks during periods of economic instability. The findings reveal a significant negative effect of the ESG disclosure score on ROA and ROI, while ROE remains unaffected. Companies with higher ESG scores incur additional costs related to sustainability, which can hinder short-term profitability and asset efficiency. Larger and older companies perform better financially, highlighting the role of operational maturity. Additionally, the environmental score negatively impacts ROA due to the costs associated with sustainability practices. These results suggest that the economic trade-offs of ESG integration are more pronounced during periods of instability, offering valuable insights for policymakers and business leaders.

	abstract = {Firms worldwide are strengthening environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, indicating a bidirectional association between financial and non-financial performance. Understanding the ambiguity around the predictors of the firm's ESG performance, we attempt to reappraise the ESG- firm performance (FP) linkage using the firms indexed in the NIFTY 100 ESG index spanning 2014 to 2023. Our findings highlight that market forces significantly influence firms' ESG performance; however, in emerging economies, the direct relationship between ESG and FP appears to be insignificant. Surprisingly, corporate governance positively moderates the ESG–FP linkage, strengthening this association. Among the four proxies for market forces, the Volatility Index (VIX) shows a significant impact, where higher market volatility is associated with improved ESG performance, and lower volatility corresponds to weaker ESG performance. Conversely, the World Uncertainty Index (WUI) exhibits a negative significance, suggesting that higher WUI adversely affects the ESG performance of firms in emerging economies, while lower WUI has a favourable effect. Green bonds have a positive and significant effect on overall ESG performance and on social and governance dimensions; however, their influence on environmental performance is not significant, raising concerns about potential greenwashing trends. Strikingly, our findings indicate that emerging economy firms do not consider systematic risk, suggesting that investors' risk perceptions remain unchanged regardless of whether firms over- or under-invest in ESG initiatives. Our research calls for greater attention to policymakers by providing accurate reasonings for the ESG performance of emerging economy firms. © 2025 The Author(s).

The empirical analysis is based on a sample of financial and non-financial firms selected from FTSE ALL-listed companies over the period (2012–2022). Findings: Findings of this study reveal that ESG score has a statistically significant impact on both financial and non-financial firms. An increase in firm ESG performance significantly increases the likelihood of M&A. The results reveal that the impact of ESG on firm financial performance is negative and significant, but this is not the case for non-financial firms where the impact despite being positive is insignificant. Research limitations/implications: This research was conducted using data from firms within the UK context.

Integrating ESG into operational and strategic organisational activities enhances attractiveness to potential bidders and contributes to sustainable financial performance because acquiring targets with high ESG performance can have a positive effect on the acquirer’s post-merger market value, thereby strongly confirming the use of ESG as a value-enhancing strategy to promote corporate external growth. Originality/value: Our findings add to the extant literature, a recent empirical evidence that, to the best of our knowledge, our this study is among the first to examine the influence of ESG on M&A and firm performance through comparison between the financial and non-financial sectors. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic downturn in the global stock markets. Investors look for safe stocks that can provide better risk-adjusted returns. Stocks with higher Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores can be good choices for investors. This study focuses on this argument by examining the relationship between ESG indicators and stock returns while considering financial and macroeconomic variables. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, 39 non-financial firms listed in Nifty-50, for which data is available, have been included. Panel data from 2018 to 2021 is collected to examine this relationship in the presence of COVID-19. Additionally, the panel regression method is used. Findings: The empirical findings indicate a positive relationship between ESG scores and stock returns. This relationship holds even when the control variables like Return on Assets (ROA), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Return on Equity (ROE), age, size, leverage of the firm, inflation, and crisis period are used in the model. Originality/value: This study contributes by examining the linkage between ESG indicators and stock return while controlling the impact of the financial and macroeconomic variables in Indian markets, which has not been undertaken so far. Moreover, this is the first study to use the ESG score data of S&P Global, which gives more weight to the material factors of a firm.

The study uses a sample of 100 non-financial organizations from 2019 to 2023 (500 firm-year observations). This study uses panel data analysis and a random-effects regression model to examine the relationship between ESG disclosure and firm profitability as assessed by return on assets (ROA). To assess ESG disclosure, this study developed a comprehensive ESG disclosure index based on worldwide ESG guidelines and Saudi-related regulations. The regression results show a significantly positive relationship between ESG disclosure and firm profitability, emphasizing the financial benefits of corporate transparency and sustainability. This finding is consistent with the stakeholder theory, implying that firms with strong ESG commitments boost investor trust, improve risk management, and increase operational efficiency. Thus, this study adds to the ESG literature by presenting empirical evidence from Saudi Arabia, a growing country that is undergoing regulatory transition. Additionally, this study’s notable contribution is the development of a comprehensive ESG disclosure index tailored for the Saudi corporate landscape, integrating global reporting standards with local regulatory requirements. This index enhances the assessment of ESG transparency and offers a thorough tool for examining business sustainability strategies. The results offer substantial insights for policymakers, investors, and corporate leaders, emphasizing the significance of ESG in sustainable financial performance. © 2025 by the authors.},

Building on this premise, our study examines how green-bond issuance signals environmental commitment and is associated with ESG performance and valuation. While other studies examine this association, we go a step further and identify the green-bond features which are associated with ESG ratings. Using the Bloomberg database, we downloaded corporate green-bond data for 2550 green bonds. We use signaling theory as the foundation of the study. We deploy regression to test the relationships. Our findings show that green-bond features are associated with enhanced environmental and ESG disclosure scores but not with reductions in CO2 emissions relative to sales. The findings show weak associations of ESG with green-bond features. Taken together, the results contradict ‘greenwashing’ claims. However, the findings confirm that companies effectively signal environmental commitment through green-bond issuance. These insights enhance the understanding of green bonds’ nature and dimensions while providing meaningful implications for corporate policy. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The importance and relevance of sustainability reporting by food companies is growing in the wake of green compliance, especially in EU Member States, where–in line with the EU Taxonomy–stricter legislation requires more accurate and transparent sustainability reporting. From 2014, the NFRD (Non-Financial Reporting Directive) legislation made non-financial reporting mandatory only for companies with at least 500 employees and of public interest, while the CSRD (Corporative Sustainability Reporting Directive) legislation, which came into force in 2023, made it mandatory for all companies. The aim of this paper is to examine how companies are prepared to comply with the new legislation. The sustainability reporting of food companies by subsector was analysed to identify differences and compare the quality of reporting with financial performance data. The study used a content analysis with a scoring method to assess the quality of sustainability reports from the point of view of EU Taxonomy produced by companies in 2020 and 2021. The proportions of critical financial performance data within subsectors were also examined. In 2020 and 2021, the companies analysed accounted for over 50% of the sector’s total net revenue, net profit, and foreign registered capital, highlighting significant financial concentration. The results show that the content and quality of sustainability reporting by food companies varies considerably between subsectors. The subsectors, dairy products manufacturing, processing, and preserving of fruit and vegetables scored the highest on sustainability objectives, particularly excelling in climate change mitigation and adaptation. The significance of the study lies in the fact that the methodology provides an opportunity to track and re-examine the future reporting practices of companies following the legislative changes. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Economic crises offer a valuable perspective on the relationship between carbon performance and corporate financial performance (CFP). Crises test corporate performance and challenge the allegedly universal synergies that developed under “normal” circumstances. However, the current research in this area is limited and has often yielded insignificant results. Drawing from a global dataset spanning 15 years, we investigate the moderating influences of two distinct crises on the interplay between carbon emission intensity and CFP. Employing fixed-effects regression analysis, we dissect these critical periods, offering nuanced insights into their distinct impacts. The contrasting nature of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the COVID-19 pandemic is central to this study. The COVID-19 pandemic, characterized by operational disruptions and natural resource scarcities (supply-side shock), significantly amplified the benefits of carbon reduction strategies, highlighting the value of efficient processes and cost efficiencies. In contrast, the GFC did not exhibit a significant impact on the carbon–CFP relationship. This differentiation is attributed to the GFC's finance-driven nature (demand-side shock), and the resultant evolution in stakeholder preferences and organizational structures. This study extends beyond the debated territory of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores. It also provides a nuanced understanding of carbon performance's role subject to the unique characteristics of a crisis. © 2024 The Author(s).

Our analysis covers 594 articles from 2007 to 2022, divided into two distinct periods. In the first period, the pillars are centered on contextualizing theories, the impact in terms of financial-related performance, and the ethical implications within the domain of corporate social responsibility. In the subsequent period, there is a notable progression towards reinforcing theoretical foundations. The pillars shift towards more practical implications, focusing on challenges associated with investing based on ESG criteria, guiding stakeholders in adapting to this paradigm, and addressing risks tied to its implementation. Financial performance, disclosure in reporting, and socially responsible investments remain crucial matters, and the analysis of the environmental issues outnumber social, and governance ones in both periods.

	abstract = {This paper examines the transformative role of board gender diversity in shaping both the absolute performance and strategic prioritization of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) dimensions in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) firms. Using data from 132 non-financial firms (2013–2022), we employ simultaneous equations modeling and relative weight analysis to investigate this dual impact. Our findings reveal an interesting relationship: while female board representation enhances absolute performance across all ESG components, it simultaneously drives strategic rebalancing of priorities. Specifically, boards with higher female representation maintain strong governance standards while proportionally elevating the emphasis on social and environmental performance dimensions. This calibrated reweighting suggests that female directors bring distinct perspectives to sustainability strategy, rather than simply improving ESG metrics uniformly. Using the GCC context, where board diversity remains notably low, we provide novel insights into how gender composition shapes not just the magnitude but also the balance of corporate sustainability efforts in emerging markets. Our study contributes to the literature by showing that board diversity's influence extends beyond absolute ESG performance to the strategic balancing of sustainability priorities. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper scrutinizes the nexus between firms’ board characteristics; environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and industry sensitivity, with the aim of examining how the impact of board diversity on ESG performance would vary among sensitive versus non-sensitive industries and identify which board characteristics are more influential on ESG performance in these industries. Design/methodology/approach: A large sample of 31,255 firm-year observations in 5,471 companies listed in the G-7 countries from 2010 to 2022 is examined using a Heckman two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach to address the potential endogeneity concerns within our proposed relationships. Findings: The findings show that the positive influence of diverse boards on a firm’s ESG performance is particularly amplified in sensitive industries and may be attributed to the greater need of these industries to address stakeholder concerns (as posited by the stakeholder and resource-dependence theories) and mitigate agency conflicts (supporting agency theory). Interestingly, the impact of diversity in board gender and education qualifications appears to be particularly influential and remains robust across a series of regression analyses. Research limitations/implications: This study has important implications for policymakers and legislators as it provides guidelines pertaining to the composition of boards operating in sensitive industries. For practitioners and firms, the results allow for better understanding of firms’ tendency towards sustainability practices, particularly in the context of sensitive industries. Practical implications: This study has important implications for policymakers and legislators as it provides guidelines pertaining to the composition of boards operating in sensitive industries.

	abstract = {Purpose: We aim to construct the environmental, social and governance (ESG) ranking based on voluntary disclosures in an emerging market where ESG ratings are unavailable and investigate the factors influencing a firm’s ESG ranking. Design/methodology/approach: We analyzed ESG disclosures on corporate webpages and annual reports for firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) and ranked the firms on ESG dimensions. Further, we examined the impact of the firm’s financial characteristics on ESG performance using panel regressions for 2017–2022. Findings: Firms’ disclosures were strongest in the governance dimension but weaker in environmental and social dimensions. Our ESG rankings show banks as the highest and refineries as the lowest-ranked sectors. Regression analysis indicates that firms with strong financial performance and low leverage performed better across ESG dimensions. While the overall impact of ESG rankings on firm performance is unclear, stronger environmental rankings seem to offer a competitive advantage. Practical implications: As global capital markets move towards sustainable investing, ESG rankings can help Pakistan to attract foreign inflows. Further, findings on poor disclosures on environmental and social dimensions highlight the need for a standardized ESG reporting framework to make firms’ sustainability efforts more transparent to stakeholders. Social implications: Measurement and availability of ESG rankings will increase ESG awareness in investors and will encourage companies to allocate resources towards sustainable business practices. Originality/value: This research is the first attempt to gauge the ESG performance of PSX-listed firms and identify the firm characteristics indicative of ESG performance in an emerging market context. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The research also aims to analyse the correlation between the size of companies, non-financial performance, financial results and CSR actions. Stakeholder theory and legitimacy theory were used to provide a theoretical explanation of the potential relationship among the investigated variables. Our findings reveal a positive association between firm size and CSR disclosure, while the impact of financial performance is positive but not statistically significant. Moreover, non-financial performance significantly influences CSR disclosure levels. These results can guide companies in enhancing CSR disclosure to bolster stakeholder legitimacy and competitive advantage in sustainability-aware markets. Notably, this study represents a novel examination of online CSR disclosure among Certified Benefit Corporations, filling a gap in the existing literature. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {This study proposes that MNCs might withdraw from the CSR concept to gain tangible benefits, like improved corporate financial performance (CFP), and intangible benefits, such as reputational capital (RC). This represents a paradigm shift from the philanthropic end of the spectrum to the strategic win–win side, where all investments are expected to yield a return. Being tacit, quests for reputational returns are discussed in terms of corporate social performance (CSP) with its currency being RC (an intangible asset). However, this requires a deep understanding of the CSP concept and ‘good management’. This study argues that CSR will change trajectory based on three facets. First, we argue for the replacement of CSR by CSP, where ESG becomes ‘business as usual’. Second, regulatory categories (voluntary or legislated) will merge. Third, ethics endorsing ‘good management’ will alter executive mindsets, making CSP deeply embedded in corporate behavior. Organizational behavior towards CSP must, therefore, be sincere yet not embedded overwhelmingly. We extend previous discussions regarding the relationship between CSP and CFP, who present robust evidence that (1) absent CSR embedment has no/neutral CSP and CFP effect; (2) inadequate CSR yields negative CSP and CFP; and (3) productive CSR positively affects CSP and CFP. Consequently, this study argues that (4) strategic CSR (SCSR) maximizes positive CSP and that (5) excessive CSR is detrimental, yielding negative effects on both CSP and CFP. This study, therefore, conjectures the existence of a ‘sweet spot’, where SCSR optimizes CSP and CFP outcomes. The contributions address ESG engagement as a ‘sweet spot’ concept and provide a model enabling SCSR discussion, CSP evaluations, and an implementation framework for its achievement. The framework gives executives a toolbox to influence their stakeholders toward improved CFP. Therefore, our perspective supports CSP embedment, enabling firms to address business growth and sustainability requirements. © 2025 by the author.},

	abstract = {Recently, funds and corporations have adopted environmental/social/governance (ESG)-related criteria as increasingly important criteria when evaluating investments. The ESG scores of mutual funds, which pool money from many individuals, are, therefore, significant as a sign of social commitment and deliver long-term results for investors deciding in which fund to invest. However, this scoring process is not transparent, and computing ESG scores requires an extensive review and monitoring of accountancy data. In this study, Machine Learning (ML) was employed to predict six ESG scores of 3192 mutual funds by comparing the performance of the models built solely using 13 variables of ESG-controversial sectorial involvement and 37 variables of financial data. In both cases, three classification and three regression algorithms were applied to the 72 simulations. The results demonstrate an acceptable fit of the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms in regression exercises (R2 values of 60–80%) and good prediction capabilities for classification (accuracies of approximately 70–80%). The models obtained similar performance when predicting ESG scores either from financial data or ESG-controversial sectorial involvement, illustrating how financial variables are good predictors of ESG scores as data on direct involvement in non-ESG funds’ activities. Thus, a relationship between the financial performance of a fund and its ESG score exists and is predictable by ML, saving time and resources. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {This study examines the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosures and perceived financial performance within the context of Islamic finance, with a focus on Maqasid al-Shariah—the overarching goals of Islamic law. Using a quantitative approach, the study surveyed 350 stakeholders in Saudi Arabia’s Islamic finance sector, including corporate managers, investment professionals, and financial analysts, over a six-month period (May to October 2024). The findings indicate that stakeholders perceive a positive relationship between ESG disclosures and financial performance, particularly when companies align their ESG practices with Islamic finance principles. However, the study does not measure actual financial performance; rather, it assesses stakeholders’ perceptions of ESG’s influence on corporate governance, risk management, and investment attractiveness. Results suggest that companies integrating ESG principles with Maqasid al-Shariah foster greater stakeholder trust, enhance corporate responsibility, and promote long-term sustainability. However, variations in trust and investment decisions exist based on industry type, ESG disclosure levels, and demographic factors such as experience and familiarity with ESG practices. The study provides novel insights into how Islamic finance principles shape ESG disclosure practices, offering practical recommendations for improving corporate governance and sustainability. By emphasizing transparency, ethical investment, and regulatory alignment, these findings contribute to ongoing discussions on sustainable finance and the role of ESG in shaping Islamic financial institutions. © 2025 by the author.},

The Taiwanese food industry has encountered some difficulties in internationalization, including insufficient production capacity, high tariffs, the lack of long-term planning by the government, and inadequate support from internal organizations. Overall, it is relatively problematic for the food industry to achieve internationalization, and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) is the trend of sustainable development for enterprises to fulfill. This paper empirically explores the joint impact of the degree of internationalization and ESG ratings on the financial performance of the Taiwanese food industry from 2015 to 2021. Our empirical results found that international diversification and ESG performance have joint positive and significant effects on the return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and return on sales (ROS) of the food industry, respectively. This means that the higher the internationalization of overseas companies in the food industry, the better the ESG performance would significantly improve its financial performance. © 2025 by the authors.},

Investors and financial advisors are increasingly confronted with the crucial question of whether their dedication to ESG values enhances or hampers their pursuit of financial performance. Addressing this crucial issue, our research delves into the impact of ESG ratings on financial performance, exploring a cutting-edge machine learning approach powered by the Extreme Gradient algorithm. Our study centers on US-registered equity funds with a global investment scope, and performs a cross-sectional data analysis for annualized fund returns for a five-year period (2017–2021). To fortify our analysis, we synergistically amalgamate data from three prominent mutual fund databases, thereby bolstering data completeness, accuracy, and consistency. Through thorough examination, our findings substantiate the positive correlation between ESG ratings and fund performance. In fact, our investigation identifies ESG score as one of the dominant variables, ranking among the top five with the highest predictive capacity for mutual fund performance. As sustainable investing continues to ascend as a central force within financial markets, our study underscores the pivotal role that ESG factors play in shaping investment outcomes. Our research provides socially responsible investors and financial advisors with valuable insights, empowering them to make informed decisions that align their financial objectives with their commitment to ESG values. © The Author(s) 2024.},

However, it is expected that the long-term benefits of ESG engagement outweigh these costs, leading to superior performance. Despite extensive research on the ESG–performance relationship, findings remain mixed. This study examines the moderating effect of country governance, measured by the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGIs), on the relationship between firms’ ESG scores and their financial and market performance in the European context. Using a two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression model and a dataset spanning 12 years (2011–2022) for 2083 listed European firms, we find that WGI significantly moderates the ESG–performance relationship. Our results indicate that ESG engagement alone has a negative impact on financial performance (ROA), suggesting that the costs associated with ESG investments often outweigh their short-term benefits. However, strong governance structures mitigate these costs, transforming ESG investments into value-enhancing activities. Conversely, ESG engagement positively influences market performance (Tobin’s Q), signaling long-term value to investors. Yet, in jurisdictions with strong governance frameworks, this effect diminishes, as ESG compliance becomes a baseline expectation rather than a differentiating factor. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As the market undergoes a critical phase where green transformation and financial performance advance in tandem, it is essential to evaluate whether firms can drive societal progress while maximizing profits. However, existing research predominantly examines the effects of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) on firm-level performance or broader macroeconomic outcomes, while the micro-level economic spillover effects of ESG remain largely overlooked. This study utilizes a newly developed microeconomic growth indicator derived from Nighttime Light data to evaluate the positive impact of ESG advantages on the economic development of neighboring regions among A-share listed companies in China's stock market from 2012 to 2021, while also exploring the underlying mechanisms driving this effect. The results show the following: (1) ESG advantages significantly promote economic development in the neighboring region and effectively mitigate the issue of endogeneity through instrumental variable methods. (2) Even after addressing issues related to firm location choices, greenwashing behavior, adjustments to nightlight grids, substitution of core explanatory variables, and ruling out a range of competing hypotheses through robustness checks, the conclusions remain valid. (3) The mechanistic analysis seems to reveal that ESG-advantaged firms mainly promote green innovation, increase labor income, and form the agglomeration of firms, which in turn boosts the economic development of the neighboring region. (4) Heterogeneity analysis further elucidates that, compared to non-ESG companies, ESG companies exert a significantly stronger positive influence on the economic growth of neighboring regions. All three dimensions of ESG positively impact the economic development of neighboring areas. The economic effects of ESG advantages exhibit a diminishing trend with increasing distance. In addition, the improvement of ESG in polluting industries and manufacturing enterprises is more effective. (5) Meanwhile, the generalized random forest model is used to further find that there is a nonlinear situation of heterogeneous effects of ESG advantages. The results of this paper would provide an important reference for Chinese enterprises to boom in neighboring regions while pursuing the goals of “dual carbon” and sustainable development. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors are increasingly a concern in investment decision-making, especially related to their role in influencing financial performance, sustainability reporting, and cor porate governance. With a mixed method approach, this study combines quantitative and qualitative analysis to explore the relationship between these variables comprehensively. Quantitat ive analysis uses data from companies' annual reports, ESG scores published by rating agencies, as well as financial data from companies listed on the stock exchange. The results of regression analysis and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) show that ESG significantly affects financial performance, with corporate governance as a mediator that strengthens this relationship. In addition, sustainability reporting has been shown to increase investor confidence through increased transparency. On the qualitative side, in-depth interviews with investment managers and financial analysts provide insight that while ESG is considered important in investment decision-making, there are challenges in its implementation, including the diversity of reporting standards and long-term impact measurement. These findings underscore the importance of integrating ESG factors in investment strategies to create long-term value while supporting sustainability. The main recommendations are the harmonization of sustainability reporting standards and the strengthening of corporate governance to support the wider adoption of ESG-based investments. © 2025, Creative Publishing House.

However, the statistical results of previous studies exhibit variability, including significant and insignificant positive or negative relationships. Moreover, the effects of using ESG ratings from different databases are rarely considered. This paper investigates the sensitivity of data results from different ESG rating agencies by analyzing the ESG ratings of the same companies from the Bloomberg and Refinitiv databases over a 10-year period, covering 464 companies in environmentally sensitive sectors worldwide. Through examining the relationship between ESGP and FP, our research offers potentially valuable insights into the consequences of using different ESG ratings from different rating agencies. The results indicate that using different ESG scores from different rating agencies significantly alters the main results of such studies in the literature and, consequently, influences researchers' and investors' decision-making processes, depending on which ESG data source is utilized. © 2025 Borsa İstanbul Anonim Şirketi},

However, we have a limited understanding of how such coverage of supply chain partners spills over to focal firms, particularly in emerging markets. Drawing on the signaling theory, we argue that negative ESG coverage serves as a signal of a focal firm's illegitimacy, and the signal's visibility, clarity, and fit become more significant. Using samples from Chinese listed firms, our results reveal that negative media coverage of supply chain partners' ESG issues significantly reduces focal firms' financial performance. Notably, the magnitude of this effect depends on media reach and framing. Stronger ties between focal firms and their supply chain partners intensify the negative spillover. These findings underscore actively managing supply chain partners' ESG risks to avoid potential financial losses within supply chains.

Design/methodology/approach: Panel regression analyses used data from China’s A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2019, resulting in a data set comprising 6,054 observations. Findings: Despite firms’ additional financial burdens, corporate ESG investing emerges as a catalyst in resurrecting zombie firms by attracting investor attention. Further analysis underscores the significance of funding support from entities such as the government and banks in alleviating ESG cost pressures and enhancing the efficacy of corporate ESG investing. Notably, the positive impact of corporate ESG investing is most pronounced in non-heavily polluting and non-state-owned firms. The results of classification tests reveal that social (S) and governance (G) investing yield greater efficacy in revitalizing zombie firms compared to environmental (E) investing. Practical implications: This research enriches the discourse on corporate ESG investing and offers insights for governing zombie firms and shaping government policies. Originality/value: By extending the domain of ESG research to encompass zombie firms, this paper sheds light on the multifaceted role of corporate ESG investing.

To fill this research gap, we study sustainable investing in emerging markets, by examining the comparative performance of the sustainability indices in the partner exchanges of the Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative from emerging markets. In particular, we investigate three key issues that are of concern to most investors: (i) can the investment strategy of investing together in the themes of sustainability and emerging markets outperform the global sustainability benchmark? (ii) can this strategy outperform the global benchmark for emerging markets? (iii) can it improve portfolio diversification? Overall, our time series analysis and Monte Carlo simulation reveal the heterogeneity in sustainable investment performance across the world, and suggest the potential of obtaining superior risk-adjusted returns in certain regions while benefiting from portfolio diversification. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Design/methodology/approach: Incorporating both the announcement day (AD) and the effective change day (CD), the market model of event study methodology has been employed to measure the investors’ reactions in terms of abnormal stock returns in both the short and long term. Inclusions in and exclusions from the S&P BSE 100 ESG index are used as an indicator of sustainability. Findings: Surprisingly, our empirical analysis suggests that stock markets do not reward the inclusion of a company in the sustainability index.

	abstract = {The multifaceted transformations related to ESG have received many labels, and, in this context, each country has chosen words and actions carefully so as to reflect their strategic interests. But from a financial perspective, ESG should answer the strategic question: is it profitable or not? Integration of ESG in banking requires additional investments, digital transformation, and innovation so as to enhance the sector's role in achieving sustainability goals. This paper aims to give a new perspective on the profitability related questions linked to ESG implementation. Using panel regression techniques on a sample of 98 banks with global reach and aggregated assets of more than 100 trillion dollars from the major financial centres of the world, we inspect whether ESG disclosure and its individual pillars have an impact on the financial performance of banking organisations. The results reflect that, at a holistic level, ESG tends to negatively influencing banks financial performance, but considering a detailed view on each of its pillars, the results provide encouraging perspectives for all stakeholders and also lessons to be applied both top-down and bottom-up by banking organisations. The article provides a comprehensive understanding of the implications for ESG profitability in the banking sector and emphasises the elements to be considered in finding the balance between cost and opportunity. © (2025), (Bucharest University of Economic Studies Publishing House).

	abstract = {Board gender diversity has garnered significant attention in recent years as a component of internal governance. The automobile industry is a conventional sector characterized by its significant scale and the board of directors has historically been predominantly male. The share of female board members increased due to the rapid development of the new energy vehicle industry, which emerged as a combination of high-tech and traditional cars, in the last two decades. This study examines the relationship between the proportion of female directors and the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance of companies in the automotive sector. This study collected data on the proportion of female board members and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings for 50 automotive industry businesses across 13 countries from 2002 to 2022. The findings indicate a positive relationship between the proportion of female serving as directors and the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance of automotive industry. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that there was no delay in the favorable correlation between the proportion of female directors and the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance of companies in the automotive sector. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Investors increasingly recognize their potential impact on financial performance and long-term sustainability. This article explores the various perspectives surrounding ESG investing, focusing on the process of translating ESG information into investment strategies and scores. However, the process of ESG translation is not without challenges. The article thus addresses the complexities and obstacles inherent in translating ESG factors into quantifiable scores and investment process. One of the challenges in translating ESG into investment is the absence of standardized metrics and inconsistency in reporting practices. Additionally, the dynamic nature of ESG factors makes it challenging to effectively incorporate future changes. Moreover, translation challenges arise due to inadequate disclosure and transparency in ESG reporting. Addressing these challenges requires collaborative efforts from stakeholders, regulators, investors, and companies to establish guidelines and frameworks that encourage consistent reporting and disclosure of ESG information. © 2025 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices on financial risk, with operational ability and profitability as moderating variables, within the infrastructure sector in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of 14 infrastructure companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange over the period of 2020–2022, resulting in a total of 42 firm-year observations. The study employs a random-effects model for panel data regression analysis to test the hypotheses. ESG serves as the independent variable, financial risk as the dependent variable, and operational ability (measured by total asset turnover) and profitability (measured by return on assets) as moderating variables. Findings: The results reveal that ESG practices have a significant positive impact on financial risk. Furthermore, operational ability negatively moderates the relationship between ESG and financial risk, while profitability positively moderates this relationship. These findings suggest that although higher ESG scores may elevate financial risk due to associated costs and uncertainties, firms with greater operational efficiency and profitability are better equipped to mitigate and manage these risks more effectively. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses on infrastructure companies in Indonesia, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other sectors or geographic regions. Future research could broaden the scope by incorporating diverse industries and cross-country contexts to enhance the robustness and applicability of the results. Practical implications: The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and corporate managers. Policymakers can develop frameworks to encourage sustainable practices without imposing excessive financial burdens on companies. Managers can leverage operational efficiency and profitability to integrate ESG practices effectively, thereby balancing sustainability goals with financial performance. Originality/value: This study contributes to the scarce literature on the moderating effects of operational ability and profitability on the relationship between ESG practices and financial risk, particularly in the context of the infrastructure sector in Indonesia. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Our findings reveal that an increased board size significantly correlates with higher ESG scores when combined with other board diversity dimensions. The presence of female directors on boards was found to have a significant effect on environmental and social components of ESG performance. Age diversity exhibits a negative association with ESG scores, emphasizing potential disruptions from intergenerational differences. Foreign directors show no significant impact on ESG performance, suggesting that country-specific contextual factors may limit foreign directors’ influence on boards. The proportion of highly educated directors positively affects the overall ESG performance, aligning with resource dependence and agency theories. Overseas-educated directors play a crucial “bridging” role in adapting sustainable innovations overseas, positively influencing ESG performance. In conclusion, this study provides empirical evidence of the complex relationships between board diversity dimensions and ESG performance in the Korean context. These findings guide stakeholders in shaping inclusive and effective board structures for optimal corporate sustainability. © 2025 by the authors.},

Using a fixed effect model and a dataset of 1758 firms spanning 2011–2022, the analysis assesses both the direct and indirect effects of ESG performance on market valuation. The findings reveal that improved ESG performance significantly enhances market valuation and positively impacts profitability and operational capability. However, the mediating roles of these financial metrics indicate a nuanced relationship, with partial mediation effects observed.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the causality between the environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) score, which is the component of banks’ performance obtained from ESG activities, and the capital costs, market values and bankruptcy risk of banks. For this purpose, 117 banks with fully accessible data from 29 developing countries were included. Design/methodology/approach: In the methodology part of the study, the panel causality test developed by Emirmahmutoglu and Köse was used based on the periods 2015–2022. First, the cross-section test and delta tests were performed. Then, Levin, Lin and Chu, Breitung, Im, Pesaran, Shin, Fisher ADF and Fisher-PP panel unit root tests and Emirmahmutoglu and Köse panel causality test were performed. Findings: As a result of the analyses, bidirectional causality was observed between ESG and weighted average cost of capital of private banks. Similarly, bidirectional causality from ESG to company market capitalization and from ESG to the risk indicator ZSCORE was determined in both private and state banks. The results reveal that ESG components should also be considered in relation to financial performance. In this respect, it is expected to guide regulatory and supervisory institutions in the establishment of regulations and guidelines regarding the determination and promotion of ESG practices that will increase capital efficiency and reduce corporate financing costs. Originality/value: Focusing on ESG activities has ceased to be an arbitrary situation for banks. In today’s competitive conditions, financial institutions are turning to strategies that differentiate them from their competitors, such as ESG, as they have difficulty maintaining customer loyalty. Based on the lack of focus on structure differentiation before, the main research question of this study is whether the private and public structure will cause a difference in the effect of ESG activities on bank performance and cost. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The main purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of state capital participation (SCP) on the corporate environmental engagement (CEE) of privately controlled listed firms in China. Design/methodology/approach: We use a sample of 20,133 firm-year observations from 2009 to 2021. We use three different measures to proxy corporate environmental engagement and two different measures to proxy for state capital participation. We employ a difference-in-difference regression model to estimate the effect of state capital participation on corporate environmental engagement. Findings: Using a sample of 20,133 firm-year observations from 2009 to 2021, we find that SCP significantly increases corporate expenditure on environmental protection, corporate environmental performance and ESG ratings. Specifically, SCP increases environmental investment capacity and attracts more media coverage, online attention and analysts’ following, which leads to better environmental engagement. Further analyses show that after state shareholders exit privately controlled firms, CEE deteriorates, while private capital injection in state-owned firms has no significant impact on CEE. The positive effect of SCP is stronger in privately controlled firms with local government ownership, a larger number of state shareholders, longer state shareholder holding periods, those without politically connected managers and firms operating in heavy pollution industries. Lastly, we show that minority government ownership reduces firm-level toxic emissions and enhances financial performance. Research limitations/implications: We enrich the literature on the role of minority state ownership in corporate financial and environmental performance. Originality/value: We enrich the literature on the role of minority state ownership in corporate financial and environmental performance. In light of the escalating environmental concerns and the growing emphasis on corporate environmental responsibility, this study highlights the beneficial role of minority government ownership in driving environmental performance. By providing resources and attracting external scrutiny, the government, as a minority shareholder, can significantly enhance the environmental engagement of privately controlled firms. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The results show that IVC-backed companies have significantly better environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings and emit fewer greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions when compared to companies backed by CVC. This highlights that the function of IVC is to improve the environmental sustainability of businesses.

	abstract = {This study aims to assess the degree of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and its impact on selected companies’ financial performance (FP) in the emerging Indian market based on cross-sectional data collected from 528 listed companies in 2022. The ESG performance and FP data were collected from Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited (CRISIL) and annual reports. Correlation and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression have been applied for empirical exploration. The findings show that ESG performance in India is average, with a significant focus on governance and the least on environmental factors. The analysis indicates that ESG scores and individual dimensions (except social) significantly impact FP (Habib, 2022; Maji & Lohia, 2023). Findings provide evidence that ESG performance has a positive and significant impact on FP in emerging markets, highlighting the importance of integrating ESG considerations into business strategies and investment decisions. The findings of this study suggest prioritising ESG considerations to enhance FP and long-term sustainability, ESG performance should be integrated into investment analysis and decision-making processes and policymakers should establish and enforce ESG regulations to promote sustainable business practices. © 2025 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Research background:Corporate sustainability is currently one of the most popular issues in theoretical and empirical research. It generally focuses on identifying the relationship between corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP), although the CSP-CFP link is not investigated enough in the context of changes in dividend payments. Purpose of the article: The paper aims to identify the relationship between CSP and changes in dividend payouts. To do this, a research hypothesis was formulated, stating that improving CSP in environmental, social, governance, and economic dimensions increases the propensity to pay stable dividends. Methods: The main empirical research method is the panel logistic regression model, which includes variables of corporate sustainability. Additionally, descriptive statistics and the Pearson correlation coefficients are analyzed. The empirical research was conducted using data on the top global companies listed in the Global 500 of 2021 from the period of 2011–2021. All required data were retrieved from the Refinitiv (Thomson Reuters) Eikon database. Findings & Value added: The main conclusion of the paper is that when all dimensions of corporate sustainability are integrated in the long run, only the strong effectiveness of corporate systems and processes inside a company make board members maintain dividends at the previous levels. It means that the research hypothesis cannot be confirmed for all corporate sustainability dimensions considered together. The value added of the paper is that the authors considered the long-term returns pillar score as one of the independent variables, which is not a commonly used approach, although economic sustainability is a key corporate sustainability dimension. © Instytut Badań Gospodarczych / Institute of Economic Research (Poland).},

The increasing necessity for firms to address ESG concerns, which are directly linked to them, underscores their significance in contemporary corporate environments. Currently, researchers from a variety of disciplines are conducting comprehensive investigations into ESG practices within academia. The objective of this investigation is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of ESG by analyzing prior research and highlighting recent developments in ESG literature within the management sector. A bibliometric investigation was conducted using bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis. This study employs co-citation analysis to identify and elucidate four fundamental theoretical foundations of ESG research. Staying ahead of competitors, adhering to societal norms and expectations, holding leaders accountable, and efficiently utilizing resources are the cornerstones of success. Additionally, the bibliographic coupling methodology has been employed to investigate the most recent developments in the field. In this analysis, research trends in ESG are categorized into multiple categories. These categories include topics such as the correlation between ESG reporting and nonfinancial disclosure, the connection between ESG performance and business sustainability, the influence of ESG attributes on the investment market, and the relationship between ESG practices and board diversity. This study also offers a concise overview of potential research areas that are associated with ESG factors. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

It investigates the impact of sustainability committees, sustainability-focused directors, certification and assurance processes and directors’ sustainability knowledge on environmental, social, and governance disclosure transparency across firms in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: Using a quantitative explanatory approach, this study analyzes firms listed on sustainability indices in the four countries. Data from annual and sustainability reports (2021–2022) and Refinitiv sustainability scores are examined. A purposive sample of 132 companies (264 observations) is analyzed. Greenwashing is measured by comparing international financial reporting standards S1-based disclosure scores with sustainability performance scores. Descriptive statistics, nonparametric tests and logistic regression are applied. Findings: Sustainability governance structures, particularly sustainability committees, fail to prevent greenwashing. A significant correlation exists between committee size and greenwashing likelihood, with executive-dominated committees fostering symbolic efforts. Other governance factors, such as sustainability directors and certifications, show no significant impact. Younger, less profitable firms are more prone to greenwashing. Even countries with strong frameworks, such as Singapore and Malaysia, struggle with greenwashing, while Indonesia and Thailand exhibit fewer cases. This study highlights the need for standardized governance frameworks. Originality/value: This study provides novel insights into sustainability governance and greenwashing in Southeast Asia. It highlights how executive-dominated committees exacerbate greenwashing and reveals governance disparities across countries. By addressing governance immaturity, insufficient training and a lack of standardized certifications, this study underscores the importance of international governance standards. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, this rise has not been without criticism. Many have argued that business education exacerbated social and environmental issues by focusing on shareholder value maximization and short-term financial performance. Paradoxically, this criticism appears under unclear educational efficiency, declining study intensity, and grade inflation (not only) at the business schools. In response to the criticisms of their shortcomings, business schools have begun incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) values into their curricula to try to develop responsible and ethical business leaders. Despite the promising intentions behind this shift, we argue that the impact of education on students’ values may be limited. The current efforts to rebrand business schools may encourage students to engage in virtue signaling rather than foster genuine changes in values, thus creating superficial commitments to sustainability. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.},

The findings align with the stakeholder theory, advocating for companies to accord importance to all stakeholders' interests. Intriguingly, all three dimensions of ESG demonstrate a positive overall influence on the Z-Score, emphasizing their financial significance. However, a complexity emerges: while ESG positively impacts a company's Z-Score in the short term, this effect may disappear over longer time periods except for the governance factor which retains lasting relevance. Notably, workforce management, emissions control, and efficient overall management surface as critical variables in diminishing bankruptcy likelihood.

The findings reveal that banks facing ESG controversies are exposed to heightened risk, with corporate governance playing a crucial role in moderating these effects. Strong governance structures, characterized by board diversity and independence, are found to mitigate the financial risks associated with ESG controversies, whereas weak governance amplifies these risks.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to analyze how the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) guidelines and the Circular Economy (CE) are being internalized in the companies that are part of the Corporate Sustainability Index – ISE B3, from the perspective of the stakeholder theory. Design/methodology/approach: Using a qualitative approach, the research was developed with data analysis collected from multiple sources: documentary research in sustainability reports and websites, application of a survey, and conducting in-depth interviews with managers of ISE organizations. Findings: ESG practices are internalized in the companies surveyed, highlighting aspects of waste management, relationship with communities and anti-corruption. CE practices are still at an early or intermediate stage of adoption. It was identified that in the ESG and circular dynamics, suppliers, customers and employees are primary stakeholders, which have a direct influence on the sustainability context of organizations. Integrating ESG with CE principles provides a systemic view of sustainability, going beyond fragmented approaches that treat ESG and CE as isolated initiatives. Originality/value: The contribution of the study is associated with managerial support for decision-making. The practical examples presented can be used as a benchmarking parameter, contributing to the planning of organizations that are in the process of transition to CE. The focus on the Brazilian Stock Exchange’s Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE B3) is an original contribution, given that most studies on CE and ESG focus on developed economies or specific sectors. The study offers valuable insights into how Brazilian companies – which operate in the context of regulatory challenges. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations (UN) serve the idea of a better world. Although the goals may seem separate from each other, they are all interrelated, and approaching one goal can also contribute to achieving other goals. “SDG 5 Gender Equality” and “SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities” focus on eliminating gender-related disadvantages and bringing the richness of diversity into all areas of life. Hence, different notions can be encouraged and implemented to solve today’s environmental and social problems. Nonetheless, examining the literature, it is observed that there is no consensus on the impacts of diversity on the board regarding businesses’ financial and non-financial performances. In this study, we analyze the relationship between diversity measures (board size and proportion of women on the board) and the business’s environmental performance. Our dataset consists of 14 years of data from 166 businesses traded in the USA and European stock exchanges. Unlike previous studies, analyses are conducted with many tests concentrating on the short and long terms. The results indicate a positive relationship between the diversity variables (women on board ratio and board size) and the environmental performance of the businesses in the long run, if not in the short run. According to these results, it may take time to observe the positive effect, and environmental and social benefits will be achieved by continuing to work resolutely in line with the targets. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

More and more business managements are integrating sustainable development goals into corporate strategies. The board of directors is the strategy and decision maker of the enterprise and has the primary responsibility for ESG governance. The green governance of the board of directors is an important guaranteed mechanism to promote ESG performance. We use text analysis to identify environmental background directors (EBDs) and analyze the impact and mechanisms of EBDs on ESG performance, drawing on data from Chinese-listed companies between 2010 and 2022. The results indicate that EBDs significantly enhance overall corporate ESG performance at the 1% level. Specifically, EBDs significantly improve social (S) performance at the 1% level and environmental (E) and governance (G) performance at the 5% level. Mechanism analysis finds that EBDs enhance ESG performance by fostering management’s green awareness and promoting the enterprise’s green innovation. Heterogeneity analysis shows that EBDs have a greater impact on green governance in regions with weak environmental regulation, cleaning industries, and after the implementation of the New Environmental Protection Law. Our findings contribute to the literature on factors influencing ESG performance and green governance. They also provide novel empirical evidence supporting the selection and cultivation of directors with environmental backgrounds, enhancing board diversity and fostering corporate sustainable development. © 2024 by the authors.},

Thus, more companies have begun including Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues in their strategies. Research has shown that effectively integrating ESG into business models can improve financial performance by tackling environmental, social, and governance challenges. This sustainable progress can be quantified by considering the extent to which the products or services produced by the firm’s harm or benefit social welfare. The current research paper examines ESG and financial performance over time in the Transportation Industry by comparing data from Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe (EUR), Latin American and Caribbean (LATAM), and North America (NAM) regions. The research study employed a longitudinal methodology, collecting data points on the transportation industry from the first quarter of 2016 through the fourth quarter of 2019. The findings demonstrate that managers should allocate greater resources to sustainability to improve corporate value by understanding stakeholders’ impacts on revenue and costs. In this way, the transportation industry can improve the bottom-line results for its stakeholders. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2025.},

To ensure accurate estimations, a carefully crafted hypothetical scenario was presented, followed by a two-step validation process. The results revealed significant differences in tourists’ ESG awareness based on their place of residence, with local residents exhibiting a higher WTP compared to non-local tourists. Notably, environmental awareness emerged as a critical factor influencing consumer behavior, further reinforcing the applicability of ESG theory within the tourism sector.

	abstract = {The growing emphasis on sustainability has positioned environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices as a key driver for businesses seeking long-term value creation. While existing research has extensively analysed the impact of ESG performance (ESGP) on corporate financial performance (CFP), slack resource theory suggests that strong CFP can also enhance ESGP, indicating a two-way relationship (Miralles-Quirós et al., 2019). This study explores this bidirectional dynamic — specifically, the “CFP-ESGP-CFP” link — using a panel dataset of 304 firm-year observations from Indian companies listed on the Nifty100 ESG Index between 2018 and 2022. ESGP is assessed using ESG disclosure scores from the Bloomberg database, while CFP is evaluated through return on assets (ROA) as an accounting-based metric and Tobin’s Q as a market-based measure. Applying correlation analysis and fixed-effect regression models, the findings reveal a positive relationship between CFP and ESGP for market-based measures. However, ESGP negatively affects CFP across both accounting and market metrics. These insights underscore the complex interplay between ESGP and financial outcomes, enriching the discourse on sustainable business practices (Debnath et al., 2024). A key limitation of this study is its focus on Indian firms within the Nifty100 ESG Index, suggesting opportunities for future research to expand into other geographic regions and market indices for broader applicability. © 2025 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study examines the impact of ESG lending and technology-related capital expenditures on banking performance in BRICS economies. It assesses how these factors influence return on risk-weighted assets and nonperforming loans, providing insights into the role of sustainable finance and digital transformation in banking stability. Design/methodology/approach: Using quarterly panel data (2015–2023) from commercial banks in Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS), this study employs fixed-effects regression models to estimate the effects of ESG lending and technology investment on banking performance. A robustness check is conducted by segmenting the sample into large and small banks to assess the moderating role of institutional scale. Findings: The results indicate that greater exposure to high-ESG firms enhances banking performance by improving RoRWA and reducing NPLs. Similarly, borrowers investing in technology exhibit more substantial financial stability, leading to lower credit risk for banks. The effects are more pronounced in smaller banks, suggesting that sustainable and technology-driven lending strategies provide greater risk mitigation benefits for institutions with resource constraints. Practical implications: The findings highlight the strategic importance of integrating ESG and technology factors into banking credit risk frameworks. Banks should develop specialized financial products and enhance ESG and technology-based credit assessments to optimize lending strategies. Policymakers should introduce incentives to promote sustainable finance, encourage digital transformation and standardize ESG reporting across emerging markets. Originality/value: This study contributes to the sustainable banking literature by jointly examining the impact of ESG and technology investments on banking performance in emerging economies. It provides empirical evidence from BRICS, highlighting the role of institutional scale in shaping the effectiveness of sustainable finance strategies. The results offer actionable insights for banks and regulators seeking to balance financial performance and sustainability in high-growth but volatile markets. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Mechanism analyses show that trade policy uncertainty promotes corporate ESG performance through a risk-reducing channel, which has increased operational risks and dampened managers' optimistic expectations. Heterogeneity analyses find that the positive effect is more pronounced in target industries subject to tariff escalations of trade wars, non-state-owned enterprises and firms with lower foreign shareholdings. Tests of economic consequences show that better ESG performance positively affects market value during periods of high trade policy uncertainty while having little impact on financial performance. We further find that the promoting effect of trade policy uncertainty on ESG performance only persisted for 2 years, indicating that social responsibility activities compelled by export pressures manifest more as a short-term strategy with insurance value.

Analyzing 108 articles from the Web of Science and Scopus databases published between 2019 and 2023, the study identifies key variables, influential studies, and methodological approaches within the ESG/CSR-CFP nexus. The findings reveal that moderating variables such as governance structures, cultural norms, technological readiness, market maturity, economic conditions, industry characteristics, firm strategy, and CSR engagement levels significantly impact the strength and direction of ESG and CSR effects on financial performance. However, the literature demonstrates considerable inconsistencies due to diverse research designs, varying definitions of ESG and CFP, and underrepresentation of moderating variables such as social and cultural factors, technological readiness, and firm-specific characteristics. The study highlights the need for more standardized variables, advanced research methodologies, and a broader exploration of these underexamined moderating variables to develop a more nuanced understanding of how ESG and CSR initiatives influence corporate financial outcomes.

Empirical evidence shows a positive association between a firm's SASB ESG Score and financial performance, along with a negative link to financial risks. In contrast, the ESG Disclosure Score fails to predict a firm's financial performance and risks. Furthermore, the effect of the SASB ESG Score on profit is associated with higher market competitiveness and greater operational efficiency. On the other hand, the risk reduction is associated with the mitigation of stock price crash risks. The piecewise linear regression analysis suggests that superior SASB ESG Scores are linked to enhanced financial performance and reduced financial risks. We attribute the findings to the efficient allocation of resources toward ESG activities that hold material significance within a firm's specific industry. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.},

It also examines how this relationship varies across industries and financial contexts. Design/methodology/approach: The research draws on a decadal dataset (2013–2023) comprising 4,727 firm-year observations from 682 firms operating in the European Union. Data were sourced from Refinitiv and analyzed using the STATA software package. A system-GMM regression approach was employed to ensure the robustness and validity of the findings. Findings: The study underscores the positive impact of board gender diversity on overall ESG performance and governance outcomes. However, its relatively insignificant influence on social performance highlights the need for independent, firm-specific social policies and corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies. The findings emphasize the role of sustainability incentives in strengthening the gender-–ESG link across different industries. Practical implications: The results provide valuable insights for policymakers, corporate managers and board members on enhancing ESG performance through gender-diverse boards and well-structured incentive mechanisms. Firms are encouraged to adopt tailored CSR policies to address the social performance gap identified in this research. Originality/value: This study enriches the existing ESG literature by elaborating on the strategic importance of board gender diversity and its potential to leverage board composition for sustainable performance. It also contributes to the stakeholder and agency theory literature by broadening the understanding of how board diversity influences ESG outcomes. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to explore the strategic integration of Sharia-compliant and environmental, social and governance (ESG)-focused investments within global equity portfolio optimization frameworks, with a particular emphasis on variance minimization and dynamic rebalancing techniques. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses historical data from Sharia-compliant, ESG-focused and conventional equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Advanced mean-variance optimization methodologies via quadratic programming are employed, encompassing static optimization with and without a 50% cap on individual asset weights, dynamic optimization with monthly rebalancing and rolling window optimization. Findings: Portfolios integrating Sharia-compliant investments frequently outperform those composed solely of conventional equity ETFs. Dynamic optimization with monthly rebalancing achieved the highest Sharpe ratio (1.3708) and demonstrated enhanced portfolio resilience during market turbulence, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Sharia-compliant investments showed substantial allocations during key periods, with weights reaching up to 100% in the first half of 2020. In contrast, ESG-focused investments exhibited more limited and sporadic allocations, reflecting a more opportunistic role in the portfolio. Practical implications: The findings reaffirm the critical role of Sharia-compliant investments in well-diversified, risk-conscious portfolios while also providing nuanced insights into the more selective integration of ESG-focused assets. The results offer practical guidance for portfolio managers seeking to integrate ethical and sustainable investment principles within advanced portfolio optimization frameworks, particularly when focusing on minimizing variance and dynamically responding to evolving market conditions. Social implications: The study contributes to the growing body of literature on ethical and sustainable investments, demonstrating that it is possible to balance ethical considerations with robust financial performance. The research underscores the potential for Sharia-compliant investments to play a significant role in global portfolios, potentially fostering greater financial inclusion and cross-cultural understanding in the investment community. Originality/value: This research provides novel insights by focusing on Sharia-compliant investments within non-Muslim countries, an area that has been relatively underexplored.

This study examines the dual effects of sustainability disclosure, measured by ESG scores, on corporate performance through a moderated effects analysis. Using a fixed-effects model, the study analyzes data from 4943 Chinese firms between 2011 and 2021. The results indicate that sustainability disclosure has a dual impact: It significantly and negatively affects financial performance. Further analysis reveals that these impacts are moderated by a firm's capital structure and size. Specifically, firms with high growth prospects (as indicated by a high price-to-book ratio) experience enhanced market performance due to ESG disclosure, whereas highly leveraged firms may suffer financial performance losses. Additionally, the positive effect of ESG disclosure on financial performance is more pronounced in medium-sized firms, highlighting the significant role of firm size in the relationship between ESG disclosure and performance. By analyzing the moderating effects of capital structure and firm size on ESG disclosure, this study offers new insights into the relationship between sustainability disclosure and corporate performance. It also proposes several policy recommendations, including integrating sustainability as a core objective with incentive mechanisms, promoting innovation compensation strategies, and enhancing stakeholder engagement. © 2025 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

As these regions are highly vulnerable to environmental challenges, understanding the role of governance in ESG performance becomes crucial for sustainable energy economics. Using data from the top 50 listed firms across these countries between 2019 and 2021, the research employs content analysis to evaluate ESG disclosure across 26 dimensions, focusing on aspects relevant to energy consumption and management. Findings reveal that corporate governance factors, including board size, presence of independent directors, and female directors, significantly enhance ESG performance. However, the audit committee shows no significant impact. This study emphasizes the importance of robust corporate governance structures in advancing ESG practices in emerging energy markets, offering critical insights for policymakers and corporate managers aiming to improve transparency, accountability, and sustainability in energy-driven economies.

It explores how board features such as size (BSize), diversity (BDIV), independence (BI), skills (Bskill) and duality (CEOD) influence ESG performance (ESG), and how EMT enhances or mitigates these effects. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a quantitative approach using a dataset of 91 GCC companies covering ten years (2014–2023). Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the associations among board characteristics, EMT and ESG performance. STATA was used to analyze data extracted from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database. Findings: EMT significantly strengthens the positive influence of BDIV and independence on ESG but shows varied effects with other board attributes. Larger boards and overreliance on skilled boards dilute the effectiveness of EMT. These findings highlight the nuanced role of the EMT in governance dynamics and sustainability outcomes. Practical implications: This study highlights the importance of EMTs in enhancing sustainability performance in GCC companies. Firms should prioritise board diversity and independence while balancing board size and skills to maximize EMT effectiveness. Policymakers can develop frameworks promoting EMT integration and governance reforms, aligning corporate strategies with global ESG standards for long-term environmental and social impact. Social implications: The study promotes the integration of governance and sustainability in the GCC, fostering social accountability and environmental stewardship. It encourages companies to adopt diverse and independent boards, creating broader societal benefits by aligning corporate strategies with global sustainability standards. Originality/value: This study is among the first to explore the moderating influence of EMT on the board–ESG relationship within the GCC context, bridging gaps in the existing literature. It offers practical insights into how board composition and environmental governance structures synergistically drive sustainability performance. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) is attracting increasing attention from governments and various stakeholders. However, since incorporating a large number of environmental and social governance measures into corporate business strategies will affect a company's short-term financial performance, it is difficult for ESG strategies to gain the decision-making support of the board of directors. Female board representation, on the other hand, can address the above-mentioned challenges by virtue of their acumen in environmental subsidies and their pro-environmental market image. Nevertheless, the existing literature has not recognized the advantages of female board representation in these two aspects. Based on this, drawing on the Upper Echelons Theory and Gender Socialization Theory, this paper takes the listed companies on China's stock markets from 2014 to 2022 as a sample and uses a fixed effects model to analyze the impact of female board representation (FBR) on ESG. The research findings show that when there are two or three female board members, it significantly improves ESG performance. Secondly, from the perspective of the institutional environment, environmental subsidies amplify the positive impact of FBR on ESG. However, market competition has the opposite effect and may even offset the positive impact of environmental subsidies. The heterogeneity analysis further reveals that FBR has a greater positive impact on the ESG performance of companies in non-critical industries and those that have established environmental committees. © 2025 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Businesses are regarded as the main agents that can help achieve sustainable development. Therefore, more and more firms of various characteristics integrate sustainability issues into their business strategies. There is ongoing debate on the relationship between sustainability engagement and firm performance, with ambiguous results. Our study falls into this stream of research by adding the perspective of the Central European economy. The main objective of our paper is to examine the relationship between firm sustainability performance and its financial performance in the context of various corporate governance characteristics (in particular board attributes and ownership structure). METHODOLOGY: Our research sample covers firms listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange representing various indexes (related to their size) and sectors in 2015–2021. We measure sustainability performance with our original aggregated index created by integrating key firm ESG engagement characteristics. Financial performance is analyzed from two different perspectives – accounting perspective illustrated by profitability of assets (ROA) and market perspective-illustrated by market value (MV/BV ratio). To achieve the research aims, several statistical methods were employed in the study, including selected descriptive statistics and panel regression models. FINDINGS: Our results confirm a significant positive relationship between sustainability and financial performance, as measured by ROA and MV/BV ratios. Additionally, we observe a significant positive relationship between gender diversity on the management board (the presence of women on the management board) and accounting performance. Our results provide an argument for firm engagement in sustainability initiatives, as it may improve its profitability and market value. IMPLICATIONS for theory and practice: Our study not only contributes to the corporate finance and sustainability literature by providing evidence on the relationship between sustainability performance and financial performance in the context of the Central European economy, but also provides insights for corporate governance research in terms of boards attributes and different types of ownership structures. The policy suggestions derived from our findings can benefit both managers and regulators, focusing on the sustainable development paradigm and ultimately enhancing overall stakeholder well-being. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: The originality of our research stems from investigating the relationship between sustainability performance and firm performance from both an accounting and a market perspective and using the original sustainability index developed for the purpose of the study. Additionally, we address potential gaps in existing research by incorporating several corporate governance characteristics to clarify their importance for a firm performance. © 2025, Cognitione Foundation for the Dissemination of Knowledge and Science.

The analysis focuses on key financial metrics, including Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio, and Tobin’s Q. The results indicate a significant positive relationship between ESG disclosure scores and both ROA and ROE, suggesting that transparent ESG reporting enhances organisational efficiency and financial outcomes. These findings align with Freeman’s Stakeholder Theory (1984) and earlier studies of Kumari et al. (2022), which posits that engaging stakeholders through transparent ESG disclosures improves financial results. The results carry important implications for both corporate managers and investors. For managers, the positive association between ESG disclosure scores and financial performance highlights the importance of transparency in ESG reporting. While ESG controversies may not have immediate financial effects for investors, they could harm long-term financial performance and corporate reputation. By examining the dual role of ESG disclosure and controversy scores, this study seeks to provide valuable insights for corporate managers and investors, emphasising the critical importance of transparency and ethical conduct in enhancing organisational trust and financial outcomes. © 2025, University of Wollongong.

Design/methodology/approach: This research examines 28 Indian banks (12 public sector and 16 private sector) from 2021 to 2023, using multiple regression models and a robust generalized least square (GLS) estimation. The models include Tobin’s Q (TQ) and Return on Assets (ROA) as dependent variables, while current and lagged ESG performance scores (sourced from Refinitive database) constitute the main independent variables. Additionally, five control variables specific to banks and the COVID-19 pandemic are also incorporated into the analysis. Findings: The study reveals that ESG practices have a time sensitive impact, meaning that the current year ESG activities have a substantial influence in driving financial performance of Indian banks than past year ESG activities. The benefits derive from past year ESG activities tend to diminish over time. The findings reinforce the necessity for banks to maintain dynamic and evolving ESG framework to remain competitive. Additionally, it is also found that private banks show greater initiative in implementing ESG practices than public banks. Practical implications: This study offers noteworthy inputs for academicians, banks, regulators and other stakeholders. Additionally, this research broadens the understanding of sustainable banking practices in Indian domain across different time horizons, offering an initial assessment of how ESG transparency affects bank performance during the post-mandatory ESG disclosure phase.

However, the causal pathways connecting SDS to internal capabilities, such as performance measurement systems (PMS) and human resource management (HRM) practices, and their subsequent impact on both ESG performance (ESGP) and financial performance (FP) remain underexplored. This study integrates the sustainable balanced scorecard (SBSC) framework and resource orchestration theory (ROT) to examine how PMS control types (i.e., diagnostic and interactive), PMS justice (PMSJ), and psychological empowerment (PE) mediate the relationships between SDS, ESGP, and FP. Using data from China's top 500 manufacturing firms, we find that SDS positively impacts FP by enhancing ESGP. Furthermore, PMS control types, PMSJ, and PE act as sequential mediators, clarifying the internal mechanisms linking SDS to sustainable performance. These findings suggest that strategic attention to both PMS types and employee empowerment is crucial for achieving ESG as well as financial goals. © 2025 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

This study aims to investigate the impact of these disclosures on the corporate financial performance of global enterprises in the energy sector. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the 100 most prominent energy companies listed globally by market capitalization in 2022. The independent variable is the LSEG disclosure score (ESG Score), which rates the extent of environmental, social and governance disclosures. Return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE), which measure corporate financial performance, are the dependent variables. Regression analysis analyzes the impact of environmental, social and governance disclosures on corporate financial performance. Findings: The results show that there is an insignificant relationship between environmental, social and governance disclosures and corporate financial performance in the energy sector. The insignificant relationship is associated with the low disclosure performance of enterprises in the sector regarding their sustainability strategies, impacts and performance. When the relationship between environmental, social and governance disclosures and corporate financial performance is evaluated on individual dimensions, mixed results (negative, positive or insignificant) are obtained. There is a negative relationship between environmental disclosures and corporate financial performance, a positive relationship between social disclosures and corporate financial performance (ROA only), and an insignificant relationship between governance disclosures and corporate financial performance. Originality/value: The study provides new evidence for the ongoing debate between environmental, social and governance disclosures and corporate financial performance through a global sample of energy businesses operating in different parts of the world. These businesses are expected to play a leading role in the functioning of the global economy through their sustainability strategies and practices. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This study analyses the performance dynamics of socially responsible investment (SRI) and SIN investment exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Utilising a GARCH methodology, the research examines ETF returns while considering significant COVID-19-related events to assess their impact. The study diverges from the conventional narrative of SIN stocks’ superiority by illustrating the resilience and outperformance of SRI ETFs in terms of returns and volatility stability during the pandemic. This finding challenges previous assertions in the literature and suggests a potential paradigm shift in investment strategies during periods of global crisis. The results underscore the importance of integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into investment decisions, especially in turbulent times. This study offers investors actionable insights into the benefits of SRI ETFs, demonstrating their ability to provide stable returns and reduced risk during economic downturns. Fund managers can leverage these findings to align their portfolios with ESG principles, enhancing resilience against future crises. Policymakers can also draw on this evidence to promote sustainable investment frameworks that support long-term financial stability. Overall, this study contributes to the evolving discourse on sustainable investing, positioning SRI as a viable approach that balances financial performance with societal impact. © 2024 The Author(s)},

This study aims to examine a firm’s relative amount of CSR compared to both peer firms and high CSR firms as one source of those inconsistent findings. Design/methodology/approach: This study creates a data set of financial and compensation variables using the Newsweek America’s Most Responsible Companies list (with accompanying ESG scores) and a matched set of firms not recognized for their CSR efforts. Comparisons are made on various firm outcomes between CSR-recognized firms and firms not recognized for their CSR efforts, as well as within recognized firms (using the Newsweek ESG score). Findings: Results indicate that while financial performance is higher both for recognized CSR firms (in comparison to non-recognized peers) and for firms with higher ESG scores within recognized CSR firms, compensation results differ. Specifically, CSR recognized firms have higher median employee pay and a lower CEO pay ratio than do non-recognized firms. However, among CSR-recognized firms, higher ESG scores are associated with increased CEO compensation, no relationship to median employee pay and an increased CEO pay ratio. Originality/value: The results offer an intriguing explanation for previous mixed results on CSR’s impact on firm outcomes and invite consideration as to whether continued investment in CSR actions once a firm has been recognized for its CSR leads to outcomes in line with the philosophy of CSR. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Stakeholders such as consumers, nongovernmental organizations, and public institutions have increasingly pressured companies to adopt corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies. This trend has led to the integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting into business strategies to achieve long-term competitive advantages and enhance financial performance. ESG reporting has become a critical tool for measuring corporate CSR efforts, contributing to the institutionalization of nonfinancial reporting standards. This study aims to determine how the adoption of ESG sub-dimensions affects the financial performance of companies in Turkey. METHODOLOGY: The study employed panel regression analysis on data from 21 companies listed in the Borsa Istanbul-100 index over the period 2011–2020 to investigate the relationship between ESG sub-dimensions and firm performance. FINDINGS: The findings indicate that adopting the environmental and governance sub-dimensions positively affects ROE and Tobin’s Q. However, the adoption of the governance sub-dimension negatively impacts Tobin’s Q while positively influencing ROE. No statistically significant results were found regarding the impact of ESG sub-dimensions on firms’ ROA ratios. IMPLICATIONS: The results of the research, based on the example of Turkey, are important to determine how companies’ social responsibility strategies in developing countries provide them with outputs in terms of environment, social and governance and whether social responsibility-based activities are truly sustainable strategy for companies in developing countries.The findings highlight the importance of considering the macroeconomic structure, legal system, and financial development of countries when evaluating CSR activities. The regulatory environment plays a significant role, as weaker legal protections can negatively affect the relationship between governance practices and firm performance. For practitioners, the insights suggest prioritizing environmental investments and carefully strategizing governance practices to align with investor expectations and regulatory frameworks. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: By focusing on the BIST 100 companies, this study contributes to the limited literature on the role of ESG sub-dimensions in shaping financial performance in developing markets. This research provides valuable insights into how environmental, social, and governance practices specifically impact the financial outcomes of firms in Turkey, offering a nuanced understanding that can inform both academic discussions and practical strategies in similar contexts. © 2025, Cognitione Foundation for the Dissemination of Knowledge and Science.

Employing an instrument-based methodology (2SLS) and a Heckman correction to address concerns about endogeneity and selection bias, our global analysis reveals that ESG-aligned firms demonstrate higher market performance and improved operational efficiency through reduced capital costs and improved risk management, despite initial setbacks such as negative Net Operating Income (NOI) and higher G&A expenses. In-depth analysis shows that the Environmental (E) and Social (S) components follow a similar trend, though the (E) component has no significant effect on systematic risk. While the (G) component has not demonstrated significant effects on firm market performance, its influence on improved risk management remains relevant. Regional characteristics and distinctions between developed and emerging markets introduced subtle nuances in our analysis, emphasising the crucial role of local contexts in influencing these relationships. These findings serve as a catalyst for investors, stakeholders, and real estate companies to incorporate these strategies into their investment decision-making processes. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We further explore how firms’ ESG performance and public attention moderate these relationships.

Interestingly, these negative consequences are milder in firms with unusually poor ESG performance. Our findings also reveal that stakeholders’ adverse responses deteriorate these firms’ future performance. Moreover, public attention as an information intermediary is a double-edged sword: heightened public scrutiny alleviates stakeholders’ negative reactions to vague ESG information but intensifies them when a firm’s ESG performance is extremely poor. These results remain robust across alternative measures, models, and sample selection treatments. Overall, our study demonstrates that vague ESG information elicits adverse responses from stakeholders and weakens firm performance.

Analyzing 11,757 firm-year observations from 19 emerging countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America between 2013 and 2022, we document a U-shaped relationship between ESG performance and firm value, with financial performance failing to mediate this nexus. This indicates that the market remains the dominant institutional logic in corporate ESG. Shareholders initially penalize firm value when companies increasingly incorporate community logic through ESG initiatives, despite their positive impact on profitability. However, as the benefits of ESG strategies become more apparent, shareholder valuation improves, allowing market and community logics to coexist. We term this temporality of logics the “transient penalty zones.” Our findings highlight the need to eliminate transient penalty zones through effective communication and standardized sustainability disclosure to prevent greenwashing and sustain investor trust. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {This study uses agency theory to examine how board size, compensation committee, and CEO duality align the pay-performance relationship with long-term sustainability performance. We examined companies from nine Asian emerging economies with a sustainability score greater than 0.50 between 2010 and 2019. The findings support the pay-performance relationship proposed by agency theory in the presence of a robust governance structure. The relationship is more significant in firms with high ESG scores. Our study claimed that the compensation committee has a significant role in aligning sustainability objectives with CEO compensation, which improves the firm's market and financial performance. However, board size has no discernible impact on the CEO pay-performance relationship. CEO duality negatively affects this alignment since the CEO misuses their power to influence the compensation committee's role in tying sustainability agendas with the CEO's pay performance framework. Furthermore, CEO compensation is significantly impacted by firm size, which is justified by the complexity and increased responsibilities associated with managing larger firms. Conclusively, this investigation suggests that the inconclusive evidence on CEO compensation around the world should be studied with governance mechanisms. This study advances knowledge of agency theory and the connection between sustainability performance and compensation. The findings of the study highlight the role of governance structure in aligning executive compensation with sustainability to improve long-term performance. These findings suggest policymakers promote strong governance mechanisms that reduce the CEO's power to influence the board and enhance the independence of the compensation committee to independently design the executive compensation package essential for aligning executive pay with sustainability performance. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Company boards play a critical role in ESG leadership by shaping strategy, ensuring accountability, and driving sustainability practices. However, ineffective board structures can hinder ESG goals, making the identification of board attributes that enhance ESG outcomes essential. Using data from 1931 A-share listed companies between 2009 and 2022, this study investigates how board characteristics, such as independence, independent directors’ overseas experience, board size, and gender diversity, affect environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. The analysis reveals that the combined influence of board characteristics positively impacts ESG outcomes. Among individual attributes, board independence and independent directors with overseas education backgrounds significantly enhance ESG ratings, emphasizing the value of independent oversight and global perspectives. In contrast, board size and gender diversity show no significant impact, suggesting that simply increasing board size or representation does not necessarily improve ESG performance. Unlike prior studies focusing on isolated board characteristics, this research comprehensively analyzes how various attributes influence ESG outcomes. This study fills a critical gap in the ESG literature by addressing these complex dynamics.

It specifically examines the moderating effect of fair remuneration on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses ESG metrics from CSRHub and data from Bloomberg to analyze 279 Malaysian public listed companies from 2013 to 2022. It uses regression analysis to assess how gender diversity – represented by women on boards, in managerial and executive positions – affects firm performance. The analysis includes fair remuneration to evaluate its moderating effects on the gender diversity–firm performance relationship. Findings: The results indicate that greater female representation on boards and in managerial and executive positions significantly boosts firm performance. Additionally, the findings confirm that fair remuneration moderates the relationship between gender diversity and firm performance, although it introduces unintended effects that slightly reduce the overall benefits of increased female representation. This highlights the need for a strategic approach to integrate gender diversity initiatives with compensation policies to ensure they work together effectively for optimal outcomes. Originality/value: This study broadens the literature by examining female representation not only on corporate boards but also in managerial and executive positions. The authors propose a new model promoting gender balance and fair remuneration, designed to boost the recruitment of female employees and advance workplace gender equality, offering a vital framework for organizations seeking to merge financial performance with social objectives. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Governments worldwide have implemented various strategies to reduce carbon emissions, with policies targeting high-emission industries such as energy, transportation, and manufacturing. However, developing Southeast Asian countries, including Malaysia, face challenges in balancing economic growth with emission reduction efforts due to financial constraints. Despite these challenges, Malaysia has made notable progress through its National Policy on Climate Change, pledging to reduce carbon intensity by 45% by 2030. In response to growing stakeholder demands for sustainability, companies are increasingly adopting sustainable practices to improve their environmental performance, often measured by Carbon Emission Intensity (CEI). CEI is a crucial indicator that offers a relative measure of environmental impact, considering a company’s economic output. The focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria has heightened the importance of CEI, particularly as companies with lower CEIs are viewed more favourably by investors. However, the relationship between carbon reduction efforts and financial performance remains inconclusive. This study examines the impact of carbon reduction efforts on the financial performance of Malaysian companies from 2019 to 2023. Using two widely recognized financial performance measures, Return on Assets (ROA) and Tobin’s Q, the study investigates the influence of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) participation on these metrics. The study utilizes panel data analysis on 1087 listed companies and applies multiple regression analysis using the STATA software package. The findings reveal a positive correlation between GHG emissions and ROA and Tobin’s Q, suggesting that companies not actively reducing emissions may still experience short-term financial gains. Conversely, CDP participation negatively impacts both financial indicators, likely due to the increased compliance costs associated with sustainability initiatives. The results underscore the need for a balanced approach that aligns environmental responsibilities with financial performance as Malaysia transitions to a low-carbon economy. © 2025, Econjournals.

Integrating insights from Resource-Based View and Stakeholder Theory, this research extends the literature by considering the moderating effect of governance on the ESG–market capitalization association. This study analyzes a comprehensive dataset of UK firms, employing robust econometric techniques to substantiate its conclusions. The results demonstrate a robust positive association between the overall ESG pillars and market capitalization. Environmental, social, and governance performances independently contribute to an increased market value. The analysis reveals that firms with superior internal governance structures, characterized by the presence of independent board members, board size, an independent audit committee, and the implementation of a split CEO–chair structure, experience a magnified positive impact from ESG disclosures on market capitalization. Effective governance mechanisms enhance the credibility and effectiveness of ESG initiatives, aligning them with stakeholder expectations and regulatory standards. This alignment fosters trust and cooperation, driving better financial performance and increasing market value. This research adds its voice to the increasingly compelling body of evidence that underscores the financial advantages associated with ESG integration and highlights the critical role of internal governance in amplifying these benefits.

The research utilizes a quantitative approach, analyzing data from a diverse sample of Indian firms. Panel regression analysis is employed to test the hypothesized relationships between ESG performance, corporate reputation, and firm performance. The findings confirm that ESG performance positively influences corporate reputation, which in turn enhances firm performance. Corporate reputation is found to significantly moderate the relationship between ESG performance and firm performance, with the moderating effect being most pronounced in mid-sized firms compared to smaller and larger firms. These results underscore the strategic importance of ESG activities in building corporate reputation and driving financial success. This study contributes by integrating corporate reputation as a moderator into the ESG-FP relationship and exploring the differential effects across firm sizes. It provides a nuanced understanding of how ESG performance can be leveraged to enhance corporate reputation and firm performance, particularly in the Indian context. For practitioners, the findings emphasize the value of ESG initiatives in enhancing corporate reputation, particularly for mid-sized firms.

Using cross-sectional data from 1005 EU-27 firms from Bloomberg, the analysis applies econometric models on Return on Assets, Return on Equity, and Tobin’s Q, along with interaction terms to assess ESG’s role in the digital sector. Results indicate that ESG factors affect economic performance differently across sectors, with digital firms showing a generally stronger positive ESG-performance relationship. However, sector-specific differences exist: Environmental initiatives boost performance in Internet and Telecommunications firms, likely due to positive stakeholder perceptions, while they may hinder outcomes in Advertising and Media. Conversely, Social factors enhance reputation and engagement in Advertising and Media but show limited returns in Telecommunications. These findings suggest that digital firms can improve financial outcomes by tailoring ESG strategies to industry strengths, leveraging Environmental or Social components to meet sector-specific expectations. This approach enables digital companies to align ESG efforts more effectively, maximizing value in line with industry dynamics. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2025.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effect of ESG performance and board diversity on tax avoidance practices of FTSE350 companies before and after the COVID-19 pandemic from the stakeholder theory perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Using random-effect regression analysis on data from 2017 to 2023, the study analyzes ESG scores and various tax avoidance measures pre- and post-COVID-19. A two-stage least squares regression analysis using instrumental variables is used to address endogeneity. Findings: Results show that gender, age and network diversity reduce tax avoidance, while skill diversity has no effect, and nationality diversity increases it. High ESG scores lower tax avoidance, but higher governance scores increase it. Findings hold across different tax avoidance measures, sectors and pre/post-COVID-19 periods. Research limitations/implications: Future research should explore the roles of board committees and external governance mechanisms and investigate tax avoidance in small- and medium-sized enterprises. Practical implications: The findings highlight the need for policymakers to enforce board diversity and promote ESG practices to encourage ethical tax behavior. Companies can reduce tax avoidance and enhance moral standards by prioritizing stakeholder interests. Social implications: Promoting board diversity enhances social equity, supports ESG practices, aligns corporate actions with societal values and fosters a sustainable business environment. Originality/value: The paper expands existing research by analyzing the combined effects of board diversity and ESG performance on tax avoidance. It offers recent UK evidence on tax avoidance determinants, emphasizing behavioral changes pre- and post-COVID-19. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In particular, we investigate multi-criteria portfolio modeling by integrating MEA in the complete portfolio management process of asset selection and asset allocation under consideration of financial and ESG information. We introduce a set of novel efficiency-based asset allocation strategies and conduct a broad empirical analysis using public equities from the US and Europe over a period of over 10 years with 41,932 firm observations resulting in 180 portfolios and almost 4,000 portfolio rebalancings. We show that including ESG in the efficiency evaluation has a positive effect on the financial and social performance of all asset allocations strategies. Furthermore, we find that portfolios, which are constructed using the efficiency information in the asset allocation process, outperform common screening strategies that only employ a positive efficiency screening. These portfolios also provide superior results concerning either the financial or social performance compared to traditional benchmark strategies, such as naive or value-weighted allocations. Herein, we find a small tradeoff depending on the considered region. Our results further show an outperformance compared to a standard mean-variance strategy in both the financial and social dimensions. The results highlight the benefits of efficiency-based portfolio modeling for sustainable investing and further suggest a potential application for conventional investors to create feasible alternative benchmark strategies with a stronger focus on social responsibility with no apparent downside in the financial performance. © The Author(s) 2025.},

The findings indicate a positive relationship between the overall ESG score and return on equity, although individual impacts of environmental, social, and governance scores differ. The research also reveals that employee turnover is associated with positive signals via return on assets, while social disclosure score, employee turnover rate, CSR expenditure, and female workforce participation convey negative signals to investors through return on equity. Notably, female workforce participation positively influences profitability, whereas CSR expenditure affects profits negatively. These findings underscore the prevailing policy bias towards environmental concerns and, therefore, recommend the requirement of enhancing social indicators to foster social legitimacy. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The study uses a methodology by designing a system GMM and difference GMM estimations. The findings provide robust insights into how ESG disclosure scores influence firm profitability and market valuation. The results reveal that environmental disclosure scores negatively affect accounting-based performance measures (ROA and ROE) but positively influence market valuation (Tobin’s Q). The social disclosure score consistently enhances ROA, ROE, and Tobin’s Q. The governance disclosure score presents mixed results, with system GMM showing a negative impact on all performance measures, while difference GMM indicates a positive effect on ROA and ROE but a negative influence on Tobin’s Q. Firm-specific characteristics also play a significant role, as higher leverage weakens financial performance, and liquidity management has varying effects. The practical implications of the study, through its contribution to the literature, are to provide empirical evidence on environmental, social, and governance disclosures in the context of emerging markets.

The results indicate that both control of corruption and increased board diversity have significant positive effects on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores, with a highly significant interaction effect, suggesting a substantial combined influence. Additionally, analyses based on SDG alignment demonstrate that control of corruption improves ESG performance irrespective of SDG level, while board diversity benefits both high and low SDG groups. Regional analyses further reveal varied effects across America, Europe, and Asia. These findings underscore the significance of corruption control and female representation in enhancing corporate sustainability worldwide, emphasizing the potential for firms to improve ESG performance by prioritizing anti-corruption efforts and promoting board diversity.

	abstract = {This study examines the interplay between the financial sector, industrialization, and environmental sustainability across Asian economies. Specifically, it explores the heterogeneous relationship between varied financial sector components (including banking, insurance, bonds, stock markets, and financial institutions and markets), industrialization, and environmental sustainability in Asian economies. It tests the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis by employing the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) regression and dynamic threshold models. Findings reveal that financial sector components such as banking, insurance, stock markets, and financial institutions drive industrial growth but exacerbate environmental degradation, contradicting the Kuznets Curve hypothesis. While early industrialization stages show reduced CO2 emissions, advanced financial and economic development intensifies ecological harm, underscoring the sector's limited prioritization of environmental sustainability. The multi-dimensional nature of the ecological sustainability index further highlights diverging trends compared to CO2 emissions, emphasizing the complexity of these relationships while its implications extend beyond Asia. The study offers critical insights for Latin American policymakers as well that financial instruments and markets must align with environmental objectives. Financial strategies must balance industrial progress with ecological stewardship by adopting responsible lending practices, integrating ESG criteria, and fostering cross-sector collaboration, particularly in renewable energy. These lessons gain urgency amid global crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, where financial resilience and sustainability intersect. The analysis urges developing regions like Asia and Latin America to proactively channel financial innovation toward low-carbon transitions, ensuring that industrial expansion does not come at the planet's expense.  © 1973-2011 IEEE.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study employs the pooled ordinary least squares regression on 190 listed REITs from various economies around the world over the period 2018 to 2022. Findings: This study finds an inverted U-shaped association between overall ESG and individual ESG pillars and REITs’ operational efficiency. The findings also reveal an inverted U-shaped association between overall ESG and REITs’ operational performance. However, only the environmental pillar has a significant nonlinear relationship with operational performance. The results indicate that when ESG investments are increasing from a low to moderate level, this leads to better operational efficiency and performance. Nevertheless, REITs suffer from declining operational efficiency and performance at higher level of ESG initiatives. Originality/value: Despite various studies being performed on ESG’s impact on financial performance, the majority of these research did not consider ESG’s implications on operational efficiency and performance. Additionally, these studies have only explored the linear association between the variables and are confined to the overall impact of ESG. It is the primary thrust of this paper to fill these research gaps by examining the nonlinear effects of overall ESG as well as three individual ESG pillars on REITs’ operational efficiency and performance. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Effective ESG communication and disclosure practices are critical in demonstrating corporate commitment to sustainability. This study examines how the top 20 companies listed on the Thailand Stock Exchange communicate and disclose ESG-related information, with a focus on their integration of ESG metrics into business strategies. Methods: This research employs a qualitative approach, utilizing secondary data from sustainability and ESG reports published by the selected companies. Thematic analysis is applied to identify and categorize key ESG activities and disclosure practices, providing a structured assessment of how businesses articulate their ESG commitments. Results: The analysis identifies five key themes in ESG communication and disclosure: (1) comprehensive ESG disclosure and reporting, (2) environmental initiatives, (3) employee welfare, (4) governance and risk management, and (5) community development. These themes highlight the diverse approaches taken by companies to integrate ESG factors into their business models and public reporting. Discussion: The findings underscore the importance of transparent ESG disclosure in enhancing corporate sustainability and stakeholder engagement. Companies that effectively integrate ESG considerations can mitigate risks, identify new business opportunities, and align with global sustainability standards. While the relationship between ESG practices and financial performance remains complex, existing literature suggests that strong ESG commitments can lead to long-term financial benefits. This study provides practical recommendations for Thai businesses to enhance their ESG communication strategies and strengthen their sustainability efforts. Copyright © 2025 Pimpa.},

The study uses panel data regression models to assess the relationship between ESG factors and stock returns, focusing on the moderating role of country governance and the COVID-19 pandemic. The results reveal that governance quality significantly enhances the positive effects of ESG practices on returns, particularly during times of crisis. These suggest that higher overall ESG scores are related positively to financial performance, and this relation is enhanced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the two dimensions of ESG that matter most are environmental and governance. Country-level governance is important because firms in well-governed countries amplify the benefits of high ESG scores. The opposite is true for the higher controversies scores, whose bad financial outcome is magnified during the pandemic. These results present an argument for the resilience of firm financial performance, dependent on strong ESG practices and governance frameworks. This holds great interest for investors and policymakers in associating good ESG considerations with the effective management of financial risks, leading to sustainable returns during periods of widespread economic uncertainty. © 2024 by the authors.},

To this end, a study based on the environmental, social, and governmental (ESG) variables linked to financial performance was conducted on 93 publicly traded family businesses in the global retail and consumer markets sector in 2023, utilizing data from Thomson Reuters Eikon. Control variables, such as company size, number of employees, and indebtedness, were incorporated. The methodology employed involved a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS. This analysis underscores the importance of social initiatives in enhancing financial outcomes for family businesses in the retail and consumer markets sector above the rest of the selected key variables. The originality of this research lies in its distinctive focus on the social dimension as the primary factor influencing the financial outcomes of family businesses. By highlighting the importance of social initiatives, the study provides an empirical basis that enables academics and business leaders to consider key variables in business development.

	abstract = {Synopsis The research problem We examined the graphical presentation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures after the passage of the European Union ESG reporting mandate ("EU Directive"). We also investigated the market consequences of the change in the quality of the graphical presentations of ESG disclosure. Motivation or theoretical reasoning ESG graphs assist firms' legitimation strategies, and disclosure intentions influence their use. Some firms choose to make rhetorical visual disclosures for pragmatic legitimacy without substantive actions (i.e., green impression management), while others pursue moral legitimacy with genuine sustainability actions and disclosures that align with societal expectations. Examining how firms adjust the quality of their visual communication strategies offers insights into management's ESG disclosure intentions and incentives in response to a mandatory ESG reporting regulation. The test hypotheses EU firms could comply with the EU Directive to improve all aspects of their ESG disclosures, including graphical disclosures presenting comprehensive details about their policies, risks, and performance concerning environmental concerns, social and employee factors, human rights, anticorruption measures, and board director diversity. Thus, we studied whether the EU reporting directive can improve the quality of ESG graph disclosures. Target population This study addresses the current initiatives taken by policymakers, regulators, standard setters, investors, and businesses to improve the quality of sustainability disclosures worldwide. Our study offers valuable evidence supporting the notion that mandatory ESG disclosure regulation positively influences the quality of ESG graphs, thereby better-equipping stakeholders with relevant information for their pricing decisions. Adopted methodology Our analysis began with manually collecting graph information from the top 100 EU and U.S. firms' ESG reports spanning from 2016 to 2020, resulting in a dataset of 5593 graphs. We utilized the difference-in-differences (DID) method, using the EU indicator to identify treatment firms and the POST indicator to identify the postadoption period. The interaction term EU×POST estimates the impact of the EU Directive on ESG graph quality for EU firms. Additionally, we created an ESG graph distortion index to quantify graph quality. Analyses We evaluated the reduction in ESG graph distortion among EU firms compared to U.S. firms during the postadoption period of the EU Directive. We also applied the instrumental variable approach to investigate the value relevance of ESG graphical disclosure on financial and market performance. Moreover, we utilized a structural equation model (path analysis) to estimate the indirect effects of ESG performance and ESG disclosure on the relationship between ESG graph distortion and firms' financial and market performance. Findings We found that EU firms produced better ESG graphs than U.S. firms after the implementation of the EU Directive. We also found that firms producing high-quality ESG graphs are associated with better financial and market performance. This positive relationship is independent of the influence of ESG performance but partially explained by the impact of ESG disclosure. Finally, EU firms that continued to produce low-quality ESG graphs exhibited poorer market and financial performance and increased market illiquidity in the postadoption period.  © 2025 Board of Trustees, Vernon K.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to analyze the relationship between environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings and corporate bond credit spreads within the oil and gas (O&G) industry. Given the sector’s significant environmental impact and the current energy transition, it is crucial to understand how ESG disclosure affects financial performance, particularly in terms of debt market dynamics. This research aims to provide empirical evidence on whether ESG efforts by O&G companies influence their cost of borrowing. Design/methodology/approach: This study employs a quantitative approach using secondary data from Refinitiv for the period 2018–2022. To address potential endogeneity issues, we utilize two-stage-least-squares regressions. The analysis focuses on corporate bond spreads as the dependent variable and ESG as the key independent variable. Findings: Our findings indicate a negative association between ESG disclosure and corporate bond spreads. Specifically, companies with higher ESG ratings tend to experience lower credit spreads, suggesting that improved ESG practices may lead to reduced borrowing costs. Additionally, the results show that non-state-owned companies (SOC) benefit more from ESG in terms of financial performance compared to state-owned counterparts. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by its reliance on secondary data from Refinitiv, which may not capture all nuances of ESG practices and financial performance. Additionally, the analysis is confined to the O&G industry, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings to other sectors. Future research could expand the scope to include other industries and incorporate primary data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the ESG–financial performance relationship. Practical implications: The study’s findings suggest that O&G companies can potentially reduce their borrowing costs by improving their ESG ratings. This insight is valuable for corporate managers and investors, as it highlights the financial benefits of sustainable practices. Additionally, policymakers could use these findings to encourage better ESG disclosure and practices within the industry, ultimately promoting a more sustainable energy sector. Social implications: By demonstrating the financial advantages of ESG disclosure, this study underscores the broader social benefits of sustainable business practices. Improved ESG ratings not only contribute to environmental and social well-being but also enhance a company’s financial performance. This dual benefit can motivate more companies to adopt sustainable practices, leading to positive societal impacts such as reduced environmental damage and improved community relations. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence on the relationship between ESG ratings and corporate bond credit spreads specifically within the O&G industry. By highlighting the differential impact of ESG disclosure on state-owned versus non-SOC, the research offers unique insights that can inform corporate strategies in the context of sustainability and financial performance. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The findings suggest that 20 corporates from 87 corporates are technical efficient (TE = 1) in all frontier approaches. Further, it has been observed that the three pillars of corporate social responsibility (i.e., environment, social, and governance) positively correlate with efficiency. Furthermore, it has also been observed that all three pillars of corporate social responsibility are positively related to return on assets.

The study also evaluates the scale’s value by examining its theoretical relationships with antecedents, such as place attachment, and consequences, such as eudaimonic travel experiences and destination loyalty. This study proposes a conceptual framework and measurement scale for ESG engagement behavior, offering an effective application in destination ESG management and facilitating the design of marketing and reward programs. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The study covered the V4 countries, focusing on the views of business owners and managers, collected in February 2024, on the role of the social pillar in sustainable growth. LRM tested the statistical hypotheses. The results of the V4 countries revealed that a positive perception of company sustainability is primarily shaped by transparent ESG reporting, fair employee evaluation, work-life balance standards, respect for human rights, and strong community relations. Transparent reporting emerged as the most significant factor in determining positive attitudes toward sustainability. Although building good community relations and respecting human rights were less frequently cited, they still play an important role. Fair employee appraisal and work-life balance standards were also essential in shaping a company's positive stance on sustainability. © (2025), (Bucharest University of Economic Studies Publishing House).

	abstract = {Purpose: With the rise of stakeholders' activism, integrating sustainability into business practices has become increasingly crucial for businesses. For such stakeholders, recognition from global sustainability indexes such as Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI) allows them to evaluate organizations based on sustainable integration. Further, it helps companies influence their investors' opinions and investment decisions. In this light, this study examines the stock market response to the inclusion and exclusion of Asian companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index Emerging Markets (DJSI EM). Design/methodology/approach: The study has employed the event study methodology to understand the intermediate and immediate abnormal reaction of the inclusion and exclusion event from the DJSI World and DJSI EM indexes from September 30, 2012, to November 30, 2023. Findings: Findings show that changes in the DJSI indexes have asymmetric reactions in different markets. The reaction to changes in DJSI indexes is more pronounced for DJSI EM than DJSI World. Inclusion in DJSI World showed mixed reactions, while exclusion typically resulted in adverse reactions around the event day. Inclusion in DJSI EM generated a positive reaction, while exclusion had a mixed reaction. The study found no significant difference in the intermediate reaction of inclusion/exclusion between DJSI World and DJSI EM. Additionally, investors' immediate reactions from developing versus developed countries differed, but the reaction variation disappeared in the whole event window. Originality/value: With a considerable increase in sustainable practices in Asia, companies must determine whether investors recognize and reward the company’s sustainability efforts. No other study has previously investigated the impact on Asian companies that are rapidly rising in global sustainability rankings. Furthermore, no study has examined the comparative reaction of inclusion or exclusion in two independent sustainability indices – DJSI WORLD and DJSI EM. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study employs a dataset of publicly traded firms across 16 countries within the hospitality sector from 2005 to 2022 to examine the ESG-CFP relationship. Fixed effects regression results demonstrate a positive linkage between ESG ratings and CFP, utilizing both comprehensive ESG ratings and discrete pillar ratings. These findings remain robust across various performance measures including return on assets, return on equity, and Tobin’s Q. Heteroscedasticity and endogeneity concerns are mitigated through generalized least squares and two-stage least squares methods, respectively. Moreover, the positive impact of ESG on CFP exhibits greater potency in the United States relative to other countries and was more pronounced during the COVID-19 era. These findings offer valuable insights for business executives, investors, and policymakers in supporting ESG initiatives, guiding investment decisions, and formulating effective policy directives. © 2025 by the authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of US data breaches and two major sources of CSR ratings, the authors utilize an event study framework and regression analysis to examine how breached firms’ CSR performance impacts the market’s assessment of their data breach announcements. Findings: The authors find that firms with higher pre-breach CSR performance, measured using environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) scores, experience a significantly less negative stock market reaction to data breach announcements than their counterparts with lower pre-breach CSR performance. The results suggest that CSR performance insures companies against unexpected adverse events such as information security incidents. The variations in the extent to which the market assesses CSR performance for valuation purposes should concern investors and other stakeholders. Practical implications: The findings would help investors better understand public firms’ CSR performance and provide guidance on how to value firms using their non-financial performance.

This study examines the evolution of ESG practices among companies listed on the Brazilian Stock Exchange’s Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE B3) from 2005 to 2022. We analyzed the index portfolio’s composition, focusing on changes in ESG dimensions over time. The only six long-lived companies in this index, from retail, banking, and energy sectors, were selected for in-depth analysis. We further evaluated the quality and consistency of ESG disclosures in company reports. Findings indicate relevant fluctuations in the number of companies included in the ISE B3 and variations in ESG scores for the companies. These variations may be attributed to the voluntary nature of ESG practices and the absence of standard disclosure. This study reveals a lack of homogeneity in ESG reporting, which could be addressed by establishing more straightforward guidelines and global standards. This research underscores Brazilian companies’ challenges navigating diverse ESG frameworks to align with evolving societal and environmental expectations. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The high-quality development of energy is the basis for and premise of achieving the high-quality development of the economy, and energy enterprises, as the main body of the microeconomy, are the “carrier” of its success. The national strategy of dual carbon and energy security requires energy enterprises to achieve sustainable development. In the context of global sustainable development, ESG is an evaluation technology that comprehensively measures the environmental sustainability, social value and governance ability of enterprises and improves the sustainable development ability of enterprises by focusing on the non-financial performance of enterprises and the co-creation and sharing of stakeholder value. As an important energy producer and consumer, China has not yet established an ESG evaluation system for energy enterprises that is in line with international standards and national conditions. Therefore, this paper constructs an ESG evaluation model framework of energy enterprises and studies the high-quality development performance evaluation of energy enterprises under the sustainable development strategy from the two dimensions of theoretical enrichment and empirical analysis. The model framework includes a factor structure model, performance evaluation index system, index weight model and performance evaluation model. First, integrating the new development concept and the safe development concept, the ESG connotation of China’s energy enterprises was defined by localization. Second, using the Delphi method, an ESG evaluation system with 3 sub-target layers, 14 criteria layers and 40 index layers was constructed. Third, the weights of each index in the ESG evaluation system were established by using an AHP–entropy combination weighting method. Fourth, based on the statistical data of 2021, 79 key pollutant energy enterprises listed in China were selected. The TOPSIS method was used to establish an evaluation model to empirically evaluate the comprehensive level of ESG and the performance of the E, S and G dimensions of the sample companies, and the evaluation results were analyzed. The results show that the weight ratio of E, S and G is relatively balanced; and the weight of social responsibility ranks first at the target level, environmental response ranks first at the criterion level and energy supply guarantee ranks first at the index level. The overall ESG performance of the sample companies is average, and the G performance is not ideal. The ESG synthesis and the performance of all dimensions are significantly polarized, and the development of different dimensions of E, S and G is mostly unbalanced and uncoordinated. The results demonstrate the following: (1) Using the Delphi method, the ESG structural dimension model of energy enterprises is constructed by selecting evaluation indicators reflecting the concepts of innovation, coordination, green, open, sharing and safety, which enriches the connotation and extension theory of ESG. (2) The AHP–entropy combination weighting method model can scientifically obtain the weights of indicators at each level in the ESG evaluation system. (3) The proposed ESG evaluation index system can effectively measure the high-quality development level of energy enterprises. This research can provide regulatory authorities with sustainable development policy suggestions for strengthening the top-level design of ESG; building an ESG-healthy ecosystem; and integrating ESG investment with energy security, carbon-neutral goals and corporate strategies to promote the high-quality development of enterprises. © 2024 by the authors.},

All developed financial markets offer sustainable indices to meet the ethical needs of investors. However, this is not the case for a large share of emerging financial markets. This study aims to analyze the financial performance of several MSCI European ESG indices and compare it to their respective conventional benchmarks. We investigate financial performance through time and also over different market conditions using both static and dynamic financial performance measures. The static analysis shows that the sustainable indices are as performant as the conventional index, in most cases. The Emerging Market (EM) Europe ESG Leaders index is less risky than the benchmark. However, the dynamic financial performance analysis reveals that CAPM alpha and beta are time-varying. The rolling window annual analysis shows that the EM Europe ESG Leaders index offers an interesting investment option since it beats the benchmark, less risky and offers the highest performance. Finally, the Markov-Switching analysis indicates that alphas and betas mainly depend on stock market conditions. Indeed, in high volatility market, risk-averse investors would be interested in investing in the ESG index since it reduces market risk. Moreover, when the market is more stable, the sustainable EM Europe ESG Leaders index offers better performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.},

	abstract = {This study examines the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores on the financial performance of the leading publicly listed companies in Malaysia. Using balanced panel data from Bloomberg spanning 2015-2022, the study employs multiple regression analysis (MRA) and the generalized method of moments (GMM) to explore these relationships. The findings reveal a significant positive effect of the overall ESG score on ROA, suggesting that comprehensive ESG practices can enhance financial performance. However, individual environmental (E) and social (S) scores negatively impact ROA at a 10% significance level, indicating potential short-term costs associated with these initiatives. Corporate governance (G) scores, total assets (TA), and total debt to total assets (TDTA) ratios demonstrate a significant adverse effect on ROA. The inclusion of the global reporting initiative (GRI) standard as a control variable also adds robustness to the analysis, highlighting the role of standardized sustainability reporting in evaluating corporate performance. These insights underscore the complex interplay between ESG and companies’ financial performance in Malaysia, emphasizing the importance of considering both the benefits and potential short-term costs associated with ESG initiatives. The findings of this study are crucial for policymakers, corporate managers, and investors, offering guidance on aligning sustainability goals with financial objectives to ensure long-term value creation and risk mitigation. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on ESG practices in emerging markets, highlighting the critical role of sustainability in today’s global business environment. © 2024, Econjournals.

	abstract = {The paper's main aim is to investigate the relationship between the ESG activities scores and profitability metrics of 33 public companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. By utilizing the Refinitiv methodology, we answer whether a company's environmental, social and governance performance perspectives positively affect the ROA, ROE and ROC ratios or whether there is a negative relationship. A secondary objective of the research is to investigate the relationship between profitability and the magnitude of aggregate-based earnings management in the tested sample. The moderating effect of earnings manipulation on the links between ESG performance and a company's profitability metrics is a research gap that has not been well-studied to date. This research demonstrates contradictory results: a positive relationship between the social dimension of ESG activities and the financial performance of companies was ob-served regarding ROE and ROC ratios. The negative impact of the environmental pillar rank on the ROA ratio was captured only in selected regression analyses. The governance pillar score did not statistically affect the tested profitability metrics. On the other hand, we gathered evidence that public companies with a high range of non-financial disclosures tend to alter earnings via accruals, and discretionary accruals statistically affect the ROA, ROE and ROC ratios. These finding contrasts previous research claiming that the earnings management phenomenon is a typical agency problem and that the policy of non-mandatory disclosures following the ESG assumptions could constrain the asymmetry of information and managerial information advantages. © 2024 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {Most research in socially responsible investing is about how it influences financial performance. Hardly any study investigates how it affects responsibility. We investigate how different motives of responsible investors affect portfolio design and financial and nonfinancial performance of investments. We study financial, deontological, consequentialist, and expressive motivated responsible investors. The first seek to achieve financial outperformance by relying on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) information. The second avoid investing in controversial issues. The third seek to influence the most sustainable firms. The fourth try to enhance their own social identity by investing responsibly. We find that the specific motivation for socially responsible investing does not significantly affect financial performance. However, the motivation does have a substantial influence on the responsibility score of the portfolio. In particular, deontological portfolios underperform the universe regarding responsibility performance. This might reflect the origin of responsibility scoring where controversial firms usually invest more in responsibility than less controversial ones. The other portfolios all outperform the market. This has important lessons for responsible investment funds: they will need to find out about the motives of their investors to modify portfolio design when investing responsibly. “One size for all” is no option when targeting responsible investors. © 2024 The Author(s).

We contribute to this debate by investigating the aggregate trading patterns of retail investors around a comprehensive sample of key environmental, social, and governance (ESG) news events for U.S. firms. We show that ESG news events appear to be an important factor in retail investors’ portfolio allocation decisions. Yet, inconsistent with arguments about retail investors’ nonpecuniary preferences, our evidence shows that retail investors mainly trade on this information when they deem it financially material to a company's stock performance. We also find their net trading demand predicts abnormal returns in the subsample of financially material events, consistent with retail traders benefiting from incorporating ESG-related information into their decision-making when it influences firm value. Overall we conclude that the average U.S. retail investor cares about firms’ ESG activities but primarily to the extent these activities matter for company financial performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Methodology: The study employed a panel regression approach to assess the impact of a firm’s ESG score on its performance (accounting and market) and risk. The data encompassed 1,973 firms across 17 developed and 14 emerging countries, ranging over 5 regions and 11 industries. Findings: The results revealed a non-linear relationship between ESG scores and business performance, suggesting that ESG activities initially had a negative impact and eventually had positive long-term benefits. Furthermore, the strength of this relationship differed between developed and emerging economies. It indicated regional variances in ESG performance, with Europe and the Middle Eastern countries leading the way. Practical Implications: The study emphasized the importance of considering country, industry, and regional factors while evaluating the impact of the ESG score. Expenditures on ESG activities could have a complex and dynamic influence on company performance, with differences observed across different contexts. Stakeholders need this information to understand how the ESG practices of organizations change over time and how they may affect their financial performance and risk. This may also have financial repercussions for creditors, regulatory bodies, and investors. Originality: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the impact of ESG on firm performance and risk at various levels, including country, industry, and region, in both developed and emerging economies. © 2024, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

Green transformation (GT) and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) elements have become the internal driving forces of corporate modernization. However, there is a lack of systematic theoretical and empirical research on the consequences of green transformation and ESG management on sustainable competitive advantage. Based on the core competence theory of enterprises, this research has discussed the effects of green transformation and ESG management on sustainable competitive advantages of enterprises, as well as the mediating role of ESG management between green transformation and sustainable competitive advantage of enterprises. The study took high-tech enterprises in the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta as samples and used correlation analysis, factor analysis, and multiple regression analysis to test the research hypotheses. The obtained empirical results showed that GT had a significant effect on ESG management and enduring competitive edge (encompassing both financial and strategic outcomes). There are obvious differences in the relationship between ESG management and sustainable competitive advantage in the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta enterprises. ESG management acts as a partial intermediary factor between GT and sustained competitive advantage. This study enriches the view of core competence theory and provides a reference for enterprises to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Logistics industry has become critical for each country to fully reap benefits of globalization through product, process and technology, cross-border movement of goods and services. Trade among countries, both in goods and services, has increased during the past five decades. Globalization was based on the two pillars of free trade and opening up economies for human, capital, and technology migration with minimal or no obstacles. The very fact that the integrated supply chain, which is the backbone of globalization, got disrupted with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Unexpected lockdowns and stringent travel restrictions led to a fall in production and a lag in the supply chain to meet the delivery expectations of the customers. Secondly, fast economic growth with growing competition led to huge challenges to the environment, carbon emissions, climate change, as well as social and governance risks. Efforts by the relevant global institutions to focus on Sustainable Development Goals have become questionable with increased challenges to the Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) risks faced by companies, industries, and countries. It is in this context; the present research study attempts to study the relationship between financial performance and ESG compliance empirically. The logistics industry comprises transport, shipping, warehouses, and freight forwarding activities that lead to CO2 emissions, air and water pollution, and increased use of fossil fuels, which pose a reasonable challenge to the Sustainable Development Goals and commitments made by each country to reduce the carbon footprint. However, the logistics sector companies, both global and domestic, are trying to reduce the carbon footprint with the help of innovation, technology, and sustainable development approaches. Our research question is to test whether the companies that are conscious and spending on ESG compliance have been able to achieve higher financial performance or not. Select literature review suggests mixed results leading to research gaps. Panel data models are specified and estimated.

The results suggest a surprising finding that the indicators of environmental responsibility and governance disclosure practices lead to a decline in corporate financial performance, while the social responsibility indicator does not significantly affect corporate financial performance. Expenditures resulting from ESG practices can be perceived as a misuse of corporate resources, a missed opportunity, or, alternatively, as an overinvestment. However, the decline in performance due to environmental responsibility disclosure and governance practices can be mitigated by companies that engage in internationalisation.

This study, utilizing a sample of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2010 to 2019, examines the impact of corporate ESG profiles on customer structure. We demonstrate that superior ESG profiles (primarily the social and governance aspects) contribute to reducing customer concentration. This effect is achieved by enhancing firm reputation and employee efficiency, thereby increasing market competitiveness and market share. This effect is more pronounced in firms that invest heavily in advertising and have employees committed to long-term goals. Furthermore, we discover that ESG-driven changes in customer concentration led to additional organizational outcomes, including enhanced bargaining power over customers, improved financial performance, and reduced operational risk. In conclusion, our evidence suggests that ESG significantly shapes a firm's customer structure and, consequently, its operations. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

In alignment with this agenda, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) launched the Thailand Sustainability Investment Index (THSI) in 2015 to promote Environ-mental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors. However, the number of sustainable companies has decreased, and Thailand's economic competitiveness and foreign direct investment (FDI) have declined. This research thus aimed to develop guidelines for becoming a sustainable company using a mixed-methodology approach, including qualitative interviews, survey study, and focus group discussions. Quantitative data came from a survey of 500 sustainable companies listed on SET. The findings indicated that guidelines for SET-listed companies to achieve sustainability should consist of four latent variables, arranged in order of importance: organizational support, environmental protection, social responsibility, and corporate good governance. The most critical factor identified is the accurate and transparent reporting of financial performance. Additionally, the tested hypothesis indicated differences in market capitalization with overall aspects significantly different at the 0.05 level. These insights provide valuable strategies for businesses, policymakers, and educational institutions dedicated to advancing sustainable development and improving economic competitiveness in Thailand. © 2024 xxxx},

Design/methodology/approach: First, based on a relevant dataset of companies in a region, a procedure is formulated whereby an uncertain mining technology extracts the mathematically significant linguistic relationships of ESG and its components with a financial performance metric. Second, a knowledge management process is designed based on the linguistic summaries obtained from the mining process. As a final step and drawing upon the two preceding processes, a diagrammatic system of signals is proposed for diagnosing the sustainability of the region as contributed by its companies. Findings: After this methodology is instantiated on a group of Multilatinas, it is observed that their sustainability contributions to the region are limited and that none of the identified linguistic relationships between ESG and the financial performance metric are favorable for the region. Originality/value: This is the first proposal of its kind and it can be applied to any region of the world to assess the financial performance of its companies regarding their ESG commitments. In addition, it enables the region to comprehensively monitor compliance with the 2030 SDG agenda. © 2024, Carlos Alexander Grajales and Katherine Albanés Uribe.},

Data from 400 companies listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share markets, alongside ESG scores, were derived from the Thomson Reuters ESG scoring system spanning 2013–2022. Fixed effects (FE) and quantile regressions were employed to explore this relationship. The findings demonstrate that ESG and TI have significant and positive effects on CFE. Furthermore, TI is a moderator that strengthens the linkage between ESG and CFE. Findings emphasize the critical importance of ESG performance in obtaining cost-effective financing for Chinese firms. This underscores the critical need for businesses and regulators to prioritize and integrate ESG practices into corporate strategies. Such integration facilitates access to lower-cost financing, enhances cost efficiency, and optimizes investments in green technology. The findings emphasize the importance of fostering a sustainable corporate culture that supports the alignment of TI with ESG principles in business operations. These outcomes carry substantial implications for the corporate sector and regulatory frameworks, highlighting the pivotal role of sustainable practices in driving financial performance and long-term prosperity. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {The relationship between Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) activities and financial performance has been explored within large companies. The presence of these activities in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is still in its early stages in the literature, requiring further empirical evidence. Given the importance of SMEs in economy and based on Stakeholder Theory, a set of hypotheses regarding the influence of ESG on financial and risk performance has been tested using a sample of 538 Spanish SMEs. Specifically, an index has been developed to assess ESG at both global and individual levels. The study analyses the impact of these variables on corporate performance, taking into account factors such as the pandemic period, level of disclosure and the size effect. The results demonstrate the importance of developing and index tailored to measuring ESG within this type of company, as the methodology employed can impact the outcomes. Moreover, at the individual level, all dimensions reflect a significant relationship, but the overall ESG score does not. The social and labor dimensions prove to be the most beneficial indices for enhancing resilience during periods of crisis. Finally, the findings confirm that it is more difficult for SMEs to monetize the results of ESG investment and that disclosing these activities has a positive impact. This study contributes to existing knowledge by constructing a robust measure of the level of ESG implementation and quality, providing valuable insights for SMEs on how to effectively manage their ESG activities. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {This study investigates the influence of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores on the clustering and community formation of companies within various network models. Using daily closing prices of 78 companies operating in the Borsa Istanbul Sustainability Index, we constructed correlation, mutual information (both continuous and discrete), and causality (both linear and nonlinear) networks to analyse intercompany relationships. We performed community detection using the Leading Eigenvector and Girvan–Newman methods, which revealed that companies within the same sector, particularly in the financial and manufacturing sectors, tend to form tight-knit communities. These intra-sectoral clusters reflect strong market behaviour correlations driven by sector-specific factors. Additionally, mixed-sector communities highlighted the presence of significant inter-sector dependencies. To assess the impact of ESG scores on these communities, nonparametric tests such as the Kruskal–Wallis, Conover, and log-rank were applied. Results showed that specific ESG factors, including emission, CSR strategy, innovation, and human rights, significantly influenced community formation. For instance, companies with strong performance in emission reduction and CSR strategies were found to form more cohesive communities, emphasizing the role of sustainability in shaping financial networks. Study findings underscore the critical role of ESG factors in financial market dynamics, promoting sustainable investment practices by highlighting the importance of integrating ESG considerations into investment decisions. These results suggest that sustainability metrics not only affect individual company performance but also contribute to the formation of interconnected communities with shared sustainability practices. © The Author(s) 2024.},

After going through the specified sample selection stage, 225 data were obtained. This data was obtained from secondary data for each company from 2017-2021.

In addition, f irm size and leverage also have an effect on ESG disclosure, but profitability has no effect on ESG disclosure. Primarily ESG disclosure mediates the influence of financial factors, namely firm size, profitability and leverage on firm value. The implication of this research is the importance of companies increasing firm value because it is the basis for investors' decision making in investing. To increase the firm value, companies must pay attention to both financial and non-financial factors such as ESG disclosure, because investors are getting smarter in making decisions not only based on financial factors, but also non-financial factors, especially ESG disclosure to maintain the company's sustainability. This study can also be used as a basis for formulating policies for regulators in Asian countries to improve corporate sustainability practices. arThe originality of this study is placing ESG disclosure as a mediating variable between the effect of a company's financial performance on firm value. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

Unlike previous research that predominantly concentrates on financial outcomes, this study delves into the organizational implications of ESG, bridging the knowledge gap regarding its role in resilience. This study investigates the relationship between ESG performance and corporate resilience utilizing data from Chinese-listed companies from 2010 to 2022. Corporate resilience is measured through two dimensions using the entropy weight method. The study finds a positive and statistically significant relationship between corporate resilience and ESG performance, thereby providing new evidence of the influence of ESG performance on corporate resilience. Furthermore, this impact is achieved through reduced financing costs, improved information disclosure quality, and diminished liquidity.

	abstract = {It’s been a rough few years for ESG—the popular shorthand for measuring and managing a company’s environmental, social, and governance performance. Critics on the political left believe ESG is insufficient for addressing major societal issues such as climate change; critics on the right say ESG pushes a liberal agenda. The barrage of criticism has caused ESG to lose its luster among many executives. Yet the need for a transparent way to connect a company’s financial performance with its ESG performance remains. It’s time, says Oxford professor Robert G. Eccles, to take stock of ESG and chart a path forward. He acknowledges the complex challenges that still need to be resolved. Chief among them is whether to use single materiality (which focuses on shareholder value) or double materiality (which includes societal impact). In this article Eccles recommends a pragmatic approach for corporate leaders: clearly define corporate purpose, improve transparency in ESG reporting, and engage stakeholders constructively. These strategies will help companies manage ESG pressures by focusing on material issues that affect shareholder value while also acknowledging and addressing broader societal impacts. © 2024, Harvard Business School Publishing.

Outside directors also positively affect a firm's ES performance, and this positive impact is more pronounced with institutional investor holding, suggesting that internal monitoring for corporate ES performance might complement each other.

	abstract = {The relevance of sustainable practices in businesses is indispensable due to the rising global concerns over climate threats and carbon emissions. Integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into business models and operations has become the need of the hour. This radical shift in business operations is propelled by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set up by the United Nations (UN). The advent of newer technologies, especially Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), has aided firms in data assimilation and evaluating their sustainable practices. However, a notable research gap remains in examining ESG integration in the processes and procedures of corporations through AI algorithms. This is due to the challenges of gathering comprehensive ESG-related data and the need for detailed comparative sectoral analysis. The impact and correlation of ESG scores on a firm’s financial performance have been studied, but a sectoral analysis across the globe needs to be done. The use of ML models for the textual and numerical data accumulation analysis is pertinent. The present study aims to provide a data-driven comparative analysis of three chosen sectors with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This research paper focuses on the environmental domain, as the climate threats and opportunities need an appropriate policy for implementation. This study utilizes the vast repository of ESG disclosure data from the Bloomberg database for the energy, consumer durables, and pharmaceutical sectors, covering global and Indian perspectives for comparative analysis. These three sectors provide pivotal data for addressing sustainability challenges regarding the Climate and Emission categories. The research and interpretation of numerical data are done with the help of the DL model and language model Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which analyzes the textual data from social media. The study highlights the challenges associated with ESG integration among the chosen sectors on a global platform. The findings from this study can contribute significantly to the ongoing sustainability dialogue and policy formulation. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {In recent years, “environment, society and governance” (ESG) has attracted widespread attention. As an investment philosophy focused on long-term value creation and non-financial performance indicators, ESG addresses internal governance challenges and fosters high-quality economic and social development. This study uses panel data analysis of 9125 observations from 1305 eligible companies to examine the relationship between ESG ratings, financing constraints, corporate research and development (R&D), and total factor productivity (TFP). It focuses on heavily polluting enterprises listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen A-shares from 2012 to 2022. The findings show that (1) ESG ratings significantly impact TFP for the better, and (2) financial limitations act as a go-between for the ESG ratings and TFP connection, and (3) corporate R&D also serves as a mediator between ESG ratings and TFP. These findings offer valuable insights for shaping corporate ESG strategies, driving green transformation, enhancing productivity, advancing sustainable development, and supporting high-level environmental protection. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Research background:Recently, companies have been increasingly focusing on social responsibility and disclosure. They use a variety of standards to disclose their social responsibility. The prevalence of these practices varies between companies in different countries. In addition, some companies declare CSR reporting standards, while others do not. Stakeholders need to know the characteristics of companies that declare CSR reporting standards.Purpose of the article: This study aims to reveal the factors influencing the choice to declare CSR reporting standards in Baltic public companies. Methods: The choice to declare CSR reporting standards is measured by the fact of CSR reporting standards’ declaration and the choice of GRI. The data for dependent variables are collected from non-financial reporting of Baltic public companies by making the content anal-ysis. Company visibility, financial performance, and market expectations are chosen as independent variables. Their data is obtained from the Bloomberg database. Logistic regression models are applied. Findings & value added: Only half of the companies surveyed disclosed the CSR reporting standards used. Estonian public companies prefer GRI standards, and Lithuanian public companies prefer GRI plus UNGC. CSR reporting standards tend to be declared by those public companies that are larger and operate in the “heavy industry” as well as have higher EPS and lower ROA and CAPI. Market expectations are irrelevant to the disclosure of CSR reporting standards. By contrast, GRI standards are used and disclosed by public companies with the same characteristics as those declaring the standards. Still, in this case, age and market expectations are also important factors. Younger and higher market-value companies tend to choose GRI standards. These results reflect managerial behavior based on legitimacy, stakeholder, and signaling theories. Our findings are important to investors, market regula-tors, policymakers, managers and shareholders. © Instytut Badań Gospodarczych / Institute of Economic Research (Poland).},

The sample comprises 69 listed companies in Taiwan with ESG disclosures over 2005 to 2020. The findings reveal that ESG impacts CFP in an inverted-U shaped, which is predominantly evident in the environmental and social pillars. This study validates the rising popularity of ESG investments. To enhance CFP, businesses must meticulously assess the allocation of capital to ESG to prevent under or over-investment. Managers should be aware of the TMGT effect and ensure the threshold of ESG is identified, as this is essential to balancing the cost/value trade-off, improving the CFP, and maintaining sustainable development. © 2024, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

There is less understanding in terms of the effect of different certifications and underlying mechanisms between the effect of the ISO certification on the CFP. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of different ISO certifications on the CFP of Turkish companies listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange (BIST). Based on audited financial statements of a population of 148 manufacturing companies listed during 2010–2022 and using the generalized method of moments (GMM) technique, this study shows that the number of ISO certifications has a positive impact on return on asset (ROA) and Tobin’s Q, however, no direct effect on operational efficient and R&D intensity. While there is no effect of the occupational health and safety management systems certification on ROA and Tobin’s Q, the analysis brought forward that ROA seems to be positively affected by the standards referring to environmental, energy, quality, and information security management systems certification while Tobin’s Q is positively affected by the last two certifications. © 2024 by the author.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of corporate environmental transparency (CET) on corporate financial performance under a mandatory environmental disclosure policy in China, the largest carbon-emitting country. It aims to clarify the concept of CET and investigate its short-term financial implications for key pollutant-discharging entities (KPEs). Design/methodology/approach: A multidimensional model is used to construct a comprehensive CET index for KPEs in China. Empirical tests are conducted to assess the relationship between CET and corporate financial performance. Findings: The study finds a negative relationship between CET and corporate financial performance in the short term. Increased environmental transparency necessitates higher environmental resource allocation, adversely affecting profits. The results remain unchanged from a battery of robustness tests. Despite mandatory disclosure, companies tend to provide general and vague information rather than specific and meaningful environmental data. Research limitations/implications: The findings provide rich practical implications for policymakers to improve a mandatory environmental disclosure policy. The paper also contributes to the existing knowledge by developing a measure of CET and presenting new evidence to the debate on whether corporate environmental disclosure can be regarded as transparency. Practical implications: Policymakers are advised to refine mandatory environmental disclosure regulations to ensure genuine transparency and to implement policy measures that alleviate the financial burdens of companies with high CET levels, thereby encouraging sustainable practices. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing knowledge by developing a measure of CET and providing new evidence on the debate over whether environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure equates to transparency. It emphasizes the complexity of transparency and the inadequacy of current environmental disclosure practices among KPEs. The study underscores the need for financial support for companies with high CET levels to alleviate short-term financial strains and promote long-term sustainability. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Drawing upon stakeholder theory, this article employs text analysis to construct indicators for corporate digital transformation using data from A-share listed companies between 2015 and 2022. Meanwhile, ESG performance is utilized as a measure of corporate sustainable development. Through both theoretical inquiry and case study, this study investigates the influence of digital transformation on sustainable development in enterprises and arrives at the following conclusions: (1) Digital transformation exerts a substantial positive effect on the sustainable development of enterprises. Board diversity plays a moderating role in this relationship; age diversity and gender diversity weaken its promoting effect while experience diversity enhances its positive influence. These findings remain robust after conducting various tests to ensure validity and addressing endogeneity concerns; (2) Heterogeneity tests reveal that compared to non-state-owned enterprises and high-tech firms, digital transformation has a more pronounced promoting effect on sustainable development levels within state-owned enterprises and non-high-tech companies. This article offers novel research perspectives on how digitization drives corporate sustainability in the digital era while providing practical insights for companies aiming to achieve both digital transformation and sustainable development. © 2024 by the authors.},

It attempted to verify, both theoretically and empirically, the absence and/or presence of a consensus on the nature of the relationship between the ESG criteria and the financial performance of companies. It hypothesised that, when companies adopt ESG criteria, it affects positively its financial performance. This study hypothesised a positive relationship between a company's adoption of ESG criteria and its financial performance. Additionally, it proposed that factors such as the presence of a corporate social responsibility department, integration of ESG risks, ESG reporting, and corporate social responsibility/sustainability training sessions act as moderators in this relationship. A sample of 88 Moroccan companies, spanning various sectors (34 in the industrial sector, 30 in services, 18 in trade and distribution, and 6 in new technologies), was surveyed between May 2023 and August 2023. The results of the moderating variables, which include the existence of a department in charge of corporate social responsibility, integration of ESG risks, ESG reporting, and corporate social responsibility/sustainability training sessions, underscore the importance of implementing ESG practices as a means to positively influence companies' financial performance, suggesting potential avenues for organisations to enhance their sustainability efforts for improved financial outcomes. © 2024 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

Previous literature has not yet reached a consensus on the nature of the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP). To contribute to the resolution of the issue, this article examines the relationship through evidence from China’s renewable energy enterprises. To evaluate the effect of CSR on CFP, this study takes CSR as a construct that consists of corporate responsibilities for (i) shareholders, (ii) employees, (iii) customers, suppliers, and consumers, (iv) the natural environment, and (v) social contributions. Based on data of the listed firms in China’s renewable energy from 2010 to 2016, this study shows that overall CSR can enhance CFP. For China’s renewable energy industry, shareholder and environmental dimensions of CSR positively affect CFP, while the responsibility for non-shareholder stakeholders, particularly for customers, suppliers and consumers, demonstrates a negative effect. No significant effect is identified between the responsibility for social contributions and CFP, and neither is between employee responsibility and CFP. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {This study examines the linkage between real earnings management (REM); environmental, social, and governance performance (ESGP); financial performance (FP); and total enterprise value (TEV). This study employs multiple methods to accomplish its goals, such as the algorithm of PLS-SEM, regression analyses, and additional analyses. The results confirm that firms adopting the REM strategy are likely to have lower ESGP and TEV, whereas those adopting the ESG strategy are likely to have higher TEV and FP. Using moderated mediation analysis, we also find that ESGP and FP mediate the relationship between REM strategies and TEV. This finding underscores the significance of ESGP and FP as crucial aspects that should not be disregarded when seeking to enhance firm value. The results also suggest a moderate impact of FP on the connection between ESGP and TEV. This finding implies that FP plays a crucial role in enhancing the connection between a firm's ESGP and its TEV. This study contributes to the current literature by elucidating the effect of REM and ESG strategies on a firm's total value, which is a subject that has received limited attention thus far. Additionally, this study examines the moderated mediation effects, offering valuable insights to decision-makers in organizations. These insights can aid in the ongoing improvement process and promote sustainability. Furthermore, the results may affect trading processes and financing facilities because investors and financiers are expected to pay more attention to companies that care closely about sound strategies to achieve attractive financial yields from their investments or financing. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

The results demonstrate that companies with strong ESG performance tend to have better financial performance. The connection between ESG performance and financial performance is influenced by the political ties of the CEO. Specifically, companies led by highly politically connected CEOs exhibit a weaker link between ESG practices and financial performance when compared with less politically affiliated firms. Our heterogeneity tests demonstrate that companies with low technology and cross-listing, along with companies audited by firms outside the Big 4 and led by highly politically connected CEOs, show a more significant impact of ESG practices on their financial performance compared to those with fewer political connections. Further examination reveals that political connections exacerbate the adverse effect of the environmental aspect on financial performance. This study contributes to the ongoing discussions surrounding ESG issues, especially in the context of Net-Zero and climate change actions following the international Climate Change Conferences (COPs).

	abstract = {This study thoroughly investigates the role of sustainable business models in enhancing environmental sustainability in leading manufacturing companies. Guided by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we empirically analyse the integration of sustainability goals into corporate strategies. This study identifies sustainable business models based on an analysis of the sustainability reports published on the website, examining the strategies and action plans declared by 30 companies that are leaders in the sustainability industry, according to their Dow Jones Sustainability Index World (DJSI World) and S&P Global ESG Scores. The strategies considered are aligned with the following specific sustainability development goals: 6 (water security); 7 (renewable energy); 12 (responsible consumption and production); and 13 (climate action). The dataset contains several variables, each reflecting a particular facet of a company’s environmental sustainability, as follows: energy consumption; greenhouse gas emissions; waste management strategies; and water conservation initiatives. We use a multidimensional data analysis technique called multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). After using MCA, we use a hierarchical clustering algorithm with the aim of classifying the different companies. Our findings underscore the presence of seven clusters of companies. Compared to the well-established literature on the topic of sustainable business, the innovative contribution of this study is linked to the identification of reaction time as a strategic variable explaining the different sustainable business models. The study makes it clear that the different business models are linked to reaction time to strategic alignment with environmental objectives. The country in which the company is based is also important. This study provides practical insights for companies aiming to align their practices with SDGs. In fact, the time variable provides important information in this regard and makes it possible to identify different approaches to sustainability as well as strong and weak sustainable business models; the former are characterised by a medium long-term strategic orientation towards environmental sustainability, which can be interpreted as the desire to undertake more solid and structured environmental sustainability strategies. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The study aims to analyze the impact of environmental, social, and governance performance (ESGP) on firm performance (FP) in the Gulf countries. Furthermore, this study examines how the number of female members on the board affects the relationship between ESGP and FP. This study uses balanced panel data of 424 firm-year observations from 106 Gulf non-financial listed firms from 2018 to 2021. The results show that the effect of ESGP and social performance (SP) on return on equity (ROE) is positive and statistically significant. SP and governance performance (GP) reveal a positive impact on ROE. However, a negative impact is exhibited instead for Tobin's Q (TQ). Conversely, environmental performance (EP) positively affects both ROE and TQ. Besides that, the diversity of board gender significantly and positively strengthens the relationships of ESGP, EP, SP, and GP with FP. The study concludes that policymakers in the Gulf countries and public company executives can use the suggestions from this research to change existing corporate governance rules to encourage more ESG performance and board diversity. We also emphasize the need to consider ESG performance and the diversity of the board when making plans to meet societal expectations and reach business goals.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate how the implementation of digital banking services (mobile applications) by globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs) affects banks’ performance in the USA and Europe from 2005 to 2022. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs advanced econometric methods to analyze the link between deposits and banking performance, utilizing linear regressions and multivariate Bayesian regressions. Findings: Our results indicate that customer deposits positively impact a bank’s performance after the introduction of the mobile application feature of check deposits, whereas social risk negatively impacts banking financial performance. These findings support the hypothesis that technology implementation improves the profitability and growth of traditional banks. Research limitations/implications: While findings are robust econometrically in linear and Bayesian regressions, variables reflecting the digitalization of banks remain limited. For instance, the number of mobile users or the volume of digital transactions per bank since the implementation of the mobile app is not available. Practical implications: In a rapidly growing technology and constantly changing customers behaviors, this research has practical implications from bankers’ perspective to continue the technological innovation efforts and from regulators’ perspective to strengthen requirements for the digital banking services. Social implications: We provide empirical evidence that including a banking app for smartphones’ users for remote banking services benefit the financial performance of banks. However, the social risk remains significant for banks in terms of customers' satisfaction, data privacy and cybersecurity. Originality/value: This paper employs an innovative approach to create a mobile app “discriminatory” factor and examine the relationship between deposits and banks’ performance before and after the introduction of a mobile app for too-big-to-fail banks in Europe and the USA. Additionally, we consider the social risk component of the ESG score, as a bank’s decision to implement mobile applications and technology for its customers potentially affects social risks associated with customer satisfaction and technology usability. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In this paper, we constructed the one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning models to investigate the feasibility of forecasting corporate financial performance with deep learning models, using the corporate financial features and environment, social and governance (ESG) rating index of Chinese A-share listed corporation data from 2015 to 2021. Five evaluation metrics were employed to measure models' forecasting effects, and four competing machine learning models were built to verify the improvement in forecasting accuracy brought by the deep learning models. Furthermore, we also introduced the Accumulated Local Effects method to explore the forecasting processes of the deep learning models. The empirical results show the following: (1) Deep learning models can effectively extract the time-series information in corporate data, thereby solving the task of predicting corporate financial performance with high accuracy. (2) The introduction of ESG information significantly contributes to the forecasting accuracy of corporate financial performance. For both 1D-CNN and LSTM models, the ESG rating index can provide additional useful information for forecasting. (3) The interpretable results reveal the preference and emphasis of the two deep learning models for the different features.

	abstract = {This study examines the effect of social media attention on corporate greenwashing using a sample of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2011 to 2021. We find that social media attention increases corporate greenwashing, and the effect is more pronounced for firms with negative financial performance and those with violations, supporting the pressure hypothesis. Drawing on fraud triangle theory, which considers the interplay of pressure, opportunity, and rationalization, we also find that the pressure effect is more pronounced for firms with higher CEO power, greater information asymmetry, as well as firms located in regions with a gambling culture and non-state-owned firms. This indicates that firms are more inclined to greenwash when they perceive an opportunity and can rationalize this behavior. Furthermore, our heterogeneity analyses demonstrate that the pressure effect is more significant for firms located in regions characterized by higher marketization, firms operating in non-heavily polluting industries, and those that do not provide assured non-financial reports. This study contributes to the literature on the role of social media and determinants of corporate greenwashing, providing important implications for firms' sustainable development. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

We find that besides firm-level past ESG performance and the industry-level adoption rate, country-level ESG regulations have significant explanatory power in firms’ tendencies to adopt CSR contracting. Hand-collected data reveal significant cross-country differences in CSR contracting details. Finally, CSR contracting is positively associated with subsequent financial performance only in countries with more stringent ESG regulations and stronger legal enforcement.

	abstract = {Corporate sustainability performance is gaining ever greater importance. The negative impact of climate change is manifested through heavy air, water and soil pollution. Polluting sectors, as the major players, are characterized by large amounts of emissions, waste and consumption of resources, and therefore have a larger negative impact on the environment. Companies operating in polluting sectors are recognized globally as the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions; thus, their performance is widely debated. Despite their character, such companies strive for higher profitability, better financial performance and operational efficiency. However, higher financial resources create the potential for innovation investments in companies. It is widely accepted that research and experimental development (R&D) expenditures enable new business ideas, models, products, services, and processes. However, while pursuing sustainability targets, financial results could be directed towards sustainability performance. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how the financial and innovation results of companies in polluting sectors interact with sustainability performance scores. For it, we have identified three essential pillars of sustainability: environmental, governance, and social. Using ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions, models were developed for each pillar of sustainability, including corporate financial performance indicators and R&D expenditures. The obtained results provide the insights that a company operating in polluting sector size and turnover significantly interacts with all pillars of sustainability. However, we also found that the corporate debt ratio, earnings ratio, and current liquidity have a significant relation only with environmental and social sustainability indicators. © 2024 by the authors.},

This study uses a sample of 26 banks in 5-ASEAN countries during 2016-2021. This amount is the result of data sorting conducted on 86 banks by adjusting to the research sample criteria. Using multiple linear regression analysis, this study shows that ESG scores have a significant positive effect on bank financial performance as measured by Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Price to Book Value (PBV). Furthermore, this study found that the positive impact of ESG scores on bank performance is stronger for state-owned banks compared to private banks. However, bank ownership does not affect the relationship between ESG scores and ROA. These findings suggest that law enforcement by the government through regulators plays an important role in encouraging banks to view ESG as a driving value to improve their performance. © Ruri Nathania, Erni Ekawati, 2024.},

In this context, this study considers 66 companies, examining recently structured ESG disclosures for 2022 that were published for the first time as novel data and applying a multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network algorithm. The relevant results are fourfold. (1) The MLP algorithm has explanatory power (i.e., R2) of 79% in estimating companies’ ESG scores. (2) Common, environment, social, and governance pillars have respective weights of 21.04%, 44.87%, 30.34%, and 3.74% in total ESG scores. (3) The absolute and relative significance of each ESG reporting principle for companies’ ESG scores varies. (4) According to absolute and relative significance, the most effective ESG principle is the common principle, followed by social and environmental principles, whereas governance principles have less significance. Overall, the results demonstrate that applying a linear approach to complete deficient ESG disclosures is inefficient for increasing companies’ ESG scores; instead, companies should focus on the ESG principles that have the highest relative significance. The findings of this study contribute to the literature by defining the most significant ESG principles for stimulating the ESG scores of companies in the XUSRD index. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Utilizing ESG ratings and pillar scores as indicators of sustainability performance, this research endeavors to discern their effects on measures of profitability and market performance. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a dataset encompassing more than 200 publicly listed companies in the real estate sector, this research utilizes a fixed effects regression model and instrumental variables to scrutinize the data. This approach enables a thorough evaluation of how governance, environmental and social dimensions influence the financial and market outcomes of these entities. Findings: The research reveals a complex relationship between ESG factors and financial performance, defying any simplistic, universal application. The connection is marked by diversity, deeply influenced by the unique aspects of each real estate industry segment and the particularities of regional markets. Specifically, the environmental aspect often corresponds with an increase in ROA, yet this pattern is not consistent throughout all cases. On the other hand, the social aspect is frequently associated with diminished performance indicators, while the influence of governance factors varies, affecting financial outcomes less predictably. Originality/value: With its pioneering methodology, the research delves into the granular impacts of ESG factors within individual real estate sectors and specific countries. Insights into the Real Estate Rental, Development and Operations sector as well as firms operating in Oceania, extend the conversation in an area of ESG literature that has been relatively uncharted. Moreover, the study’s illumination of how environmental, social and governance elements distinctly influence financial results injects fresh viewpoints into the ongoing dialogue on sustainable business practices. © 2024, Giacomo Morri, Federico Colantoni and Antonio Maria De Paolis.},

It is very important to demonstrate the relationship between ESG dimensions and corporate value based on empirical evidence. Thus, this study fills a gap in the literature and offers a basis for future research on sustainable investments from a multidimensional perspective of ESG.

	abstract = {Empirical evidence indicates that Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices are associated with firm financial performance, but little is known about stock market participants’ behaviour towards ESG practices, especially in unfavourable settings, where the level of shareholders’ protection is relatively weak. In this article, we examine whether ESG performance provides shareholders with value-relevant information to help them in their equity pricing decisions. Using a cross-country sample of non-financial firms drawn from 10 Middle East and North African (MENA) countries between the period from 2013 to 2019, we find evidence, which is based on the price specification of Ohlson (1995) valuation model, that ESG performance practices are positively priced by market participants and add incremental information content to earnings and book value of equity (BVE). However, when we split the aggregate ESG performance into its components, governance practice is found to be more value relevant than social practice, while the environmental pillar is found to be value (ir)relevant to shareholders. Results using the return valuation model complement and validate the price model specification. Our results suggest that social capital and institutional structures prevail on firm environmental impact. These results are robust to a set of additional tests. Overall, our empirical results indicate that market participants incorporate ESG performance when assessing firm value for the MENA region.

We analysed panel data from the 100 non-financial companies listed on the Saudi stock exchange (Tadawul) from 2017 to 2022. Using fixed effects, random effects, and generalised method of moments (GMM) models to account for endogeneity concerns, we examined the impact of ESG disclosure on the return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and Tobin’s Q. An ESG index was constructed through a principal component analysis of individual environmental, social, and governance scores. Our results indicate a significant positive relationship between ESG disclosure and companies’ key performance variables across all models. These findings are consistent with stakeholder theory and signalling theory, suggesting that comprehensive ESG practices can lead to better financial performance and serve as a positive signal to stakeholders. The study also reveals sector-specific differences, with non-manufacturing firms showing stronger positive relationships between ESG disclosure and performance measures compared to manufacturing firms. Additionally, we find that firm size, age, and liquidity are important factors influencing the ESG–performance relationship. This research contributes to the growing literature on ESG and corporate performance in emerging markets, offering valuable insights for policymakers, investors, and corporate practitioners in Saudi Arabia’s evolving sustainable business landscape.

The transparent reporting hypothesis predicts that high ESG performance signals ethical decision making and/or strong financial performance, both of which manifest in a stronger internal control environment and, therefore, fewer material weaknesses in internal controls. We find that ESG performance is negatively related to the likelihood of general internal control weaknesses, consistent with transparent reporting. We also find that ESG performance is negatively related to company-level internal control weaknesses, which are considered relatively severe. Further, we find that ESG performance is negatively associated with specific internal control weaknesses that indicate a lack of ethical tone at the top. We find support for both ethical and performance explanations behind the transparent reporting hypothesis. Overall, our results suggest that ESG performance is positively associated with the strength of the internal control environment. © 2024, American Accounting Association. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In the swiftly evolving business landscape, environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations have gained exceptional prominence, as stakeholders increasingly emphasize accountability and sustainability. This study aims to meticulously probe the intricate interplay between ESG factors, financial performance and the distinct corporate governance landscape that characterizes the Nordic region's crucible of proactive societal and environmental commitment. Design/methodology/approach: The authors begin with a data set of 899 Nordic firms across Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland. Using the Thomson Reuters database, they refine this data set by excluding non-regional headquarters and entities without ESG scores or year-long financial data. This resulted in a focused data set of 1,360 firm-years spanning a decade, forming the foundation for investigating the link between ESG factors and financial performance in Nordic firms. Findings: Drawing upon empirical data, the authors systematically dissect the correlation between specified financial ratios and ESG scores on the bedrock of sustainability evaluation. The findings underscore a partially significant, yet robust relationship between ESG endeavors and financial performance metrics. Furthermore, the intricate interplay of corporate governance dimensions’ reveals intriguing correlations with financial indicators among the surveyed Nordic enterprises. However, the findings also reveal an intricate weave that underscores the ESG and financial performance nexus. Research limitations/implications: This study addresses stakeholders’ theory and unique positions and contributes to the current discussion on sustainability reporting literature by providing empirical evidence of ESG influences on firm profitability through board characteristics in the specific context of the Nordic region. The sample for this study encompasses firms listed in Nordic countries; thus, the results may not be generalizable to unlisted firms and other countries or regions. Practical implications: This study suggests that Nordic firms are advanced in reporting ESG in response to diverse stakeholder demands as part of their regular activities. This study provides valuable insights for diverse stakeholders including researchers and regulatory bodies. Social implications: This study provides an understanding of stakeholders about the association of ESG and sustainability practices with firm profitability, which might lead to making the world a better place. Originality/value: While illuminating the multifaceted ESG-financial performance nexus, this study reveals its intricate nature. This complexity accentuates the compelling need for further exploration to decode the exact outcomes and myriad factors contributing to the array of correlations observed. Through this comprehensive inquiry, this research advances the understanding and underscores the pivotal role of a focused investigation. This study seeks to harmonize ESG practices and financial performance seamlessly within the Nordic business realm. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

High ESG scores reflect ethical practices, social responsibility, and effective governance. This paper examines the impact of ESG criteria on firm value within the airline industry, focusing on their influence on operational efficiency, risk reduction, and financial performance. Using panel data analysis, the study evaluates ESG scores from 32 airline companies over the period of 2018–2023, with an explanatory power of 36.5%. The research explores how integrating environmental, social, and governance factors into strategic management can foster sustainable competitive advantage. It focuses on utilizing internal resources, meeting the needs of various interested parties, and balancing financial, social, and environmental performance. The findings indicate that while ESG practices enhance firm value through improved efficiency and risk management, they do not always lead to higher short-term firm value. Moreover, the study underscores the significance of governance in the airline industry, where robust governance structures can mitigate risks but may also increase costs.

Using Dynamic Panel Modeling, I find results suggesting that greenwashing is a complex phenomenon with both positive and negative consequences. While it can improve a firm’s public image and potentially enhance its financial performance, it may also lead to increased risk and misallocation of resources. Greenwashing firms have a lower weighted average cost of capital due to a higher debt-to-capital ratio. They are larger, have higher institutional ownership, and lower dividend yields. On the other hand, greenwashing firms have more ESG-related controversies that can hurt firm revenues and market value, they have higher unsystematic risk, and they have lower dividend yields and return on equity. I also find evidence that there is a feedback relationship between ESG ratings and greenwashing. There is no evidence that government mandates on ESG reporting inhibit greenwashing. The implication is that ESG scoring that emphasizes reporting ESG activities while informing investors also encourages greenwashing. © 2024 by the author.},

We find that carbon emissions reductions improve company financial performance, as measured by return on assets and return on equity, with this effect being even more pronounced for companies with higher carbon intensity. Additionally, country carbon regulations are positively associated with a company's financial performance, while higher ESG scores negatively impact it. Notably, we find no significant role for CSR reporting in driving financial gains. Overall, our findings suggest that companies can enhance financial performance by intensifying their carbon emission reduction efforts while also contributing to environmental stewardship.

At this new stage of market development, the relationship between ESG rating performance and corporate innovation is worthy of in-depth study. The effect of corporate ESG rating performance on innovation based on stakeholder theory was tested using data from Chinese A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2021. The results show that ESG rating performance can significantly improve corporate innovative output and R&D (research and development) investment. This promotional effect is more significant in large enterprises, state-owned enterprises, and companies in the eastern region of China. ESG rating performance promotes corporate innovation by improving firm financial performance and expanding internationalization. In addition, ESG rating performance not only increases the quantity of innovative output, but also helps to improve the quality of R&D investment. ESG strategy, standardized and mandatory disclosure of information pertaining to ESG, improved quality of information disclosed, and promotion of corporate innovation are all necessary to help enterprises develop in this new era. © 2024 by the authors.},

The study’s population consisted of 67 companies that were chosen from the list of polluting companies given by the Central Pollution Control Board of India for the post-COVID-19 timeframe of 2020–2023. Regression analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between the variables. The results indicate that the performance of ESG will improve the financial performance of the company. In most cases, the results suggest that firms with heightened ESG performances have better market performance. Furthermore, the results show that there is no moderating effect of green initiatives. This study’s findings have important implications for stakeholders. The examination’s findings should help managers understand the state of ESG and financial market performance after the coronavirus crisis, as well as the relationship between FP and ESG responsibility fulfilment. The study has significant practical implications that may help managers create plans and guidelines for implementing and improving ESG scores to maximize performance. Population was the major limitation of the study. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Company managers are increasingly recognizing that sustainable practices are not just ethical imperatives but potential drivers of long-term value. To determine the degree to which this is grounded in business reality, a growing body of empirical studies have examined whether higher environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance predicts better financial performance. However, conflicting findings have emerged, with reviews highlighting the role that methodological choices, normative setting, and industry can play in moderating that relationship. Unlike other industries, health care has been the focus of only a handful of heterogeneous quantitative studies. To contribute to this evidence base for the European context, the present study comprehensively examined whether and how ESG score can influence both accounting- and market-based measures of financial performance. Company data from the top health care companies listed in the STOXX 600 Index over the last decade (2012–2022) were gathered and analyzed. The analysis results confirmed that a marked heterogeneity of effects across the different ESG scores and measures of financial performance exists, which is not merely due to differences in empirical strategy, with modest positive effects being estimated in most cases. Of the three pillars, the governance score consistently predicted more positive financial performance among the sample of listed European companies. The environmental pillar score only influenced accounting-based measures, though inconsistently, whereas the social pillar did not seem to have any predicting role for accounting-based measures. Future research should consider replicating the proposed analytical framework in other data settings and normative contexts to strengthen the current evidence base and therefore deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the investigated relationships in the health care industry. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper examines the relationship between employee involvement in decision-making (in particular codetermination) and corporate social responsibility, i.e. extra-financial or environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Design/methodology/approach: Literature review was done based on the following methodology: synthesis of existing knowledge, bringing together and summarising published work on the relationship between codetermination and CSR; identification of potential gaps in the literature, highlighting what has been little studied in the field; assessment of the quality, relevance and limitations of existing studies and following citation standards to acknowledge the work of other researchers. Findings: Codetermination has a rather positive impact on extra-financial performance. The special status of employee directors, who combine independence (from management) with knowledge of the company and its sector, may generate better strategic choices and enhanced oversight of management action, with positive consequences for ESG performance overall. Regarding, more specifically, governance, although codetermination inevitably upsets the internal balances of corporate boards, it does not seem to pose a major risk to their operation. The possibility of blocking decisions remains theoretical, and codetermination does not necessarily lead to oversized boards. On the social side, codetermination would have a positive impact on wage and employment management. Finally, regarding the environment, no strong consensus has emerged so far on whether codetermination improves or deteriorates corporate environmental performance. Originality/value: The originality of our approach is to propose a review of the literature on the determinants and impact of employee participation in light of concerns and reflections on the nature and responsibility of firms, particularly about the ecological and environmental crisis that contributed to shifting the challenges to less operational and more strategic considerations. We thus question how the participation of employees in the decision-making process tends to delineate a democracy that is no longer merely liberal but also “social”. We examine, conceptually and empirically, the various forms that the participation of employees may take and their impact on firm performance. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The objective of this research is to determine how the operational, financial, and market performance of companies is influenced by social responsibility practices. The methodology adopted is quantitative in nature, using the estimation of models for panel data. To quantify corporate performance, this study uses the return on assets (ROA), the return on equity (ROE), and finally Tobin’s Q ratio. Additionally, environment, social, and governance (ESG) and United Nations Global Compact (GC) scores are used to quantify SR. Our findings indicate a complex relationship between SR and corporate performance. While SR positively impacts market performance, it negatively affects operational and financial performance. This disparity becomes more pronounced when comparing companies with the highest and lowest SR scores. Further analysis reveals that the environment, social, and governance dimensions of ESG negatively correlate with ROA and ROE, but positively correlate with Tobin’s Q. The GC’s anti-corruption and environment scores exhibit a negative relationship with Tobin’s Q, the human rights dimension negatively correlates with ROE and ROA, and the labor law dimension positively influences ROE. Notably, firm size amplifies these relationships, whereas firm age has a dampening effect. This research offers significant contributions to the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the impact of social responsibility on corporate performance based on ESG and GC scores. © 2024 by the authors.},

Employing panel regression analysis on data collected from 40 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia between 2018 and 2022, this research investigates the roles of company size, board diligence, digital transformation, Shariah compliance, and gender diversity in influencing ESG performance. The results indicate that larger firms are generally associated with lower ESG ratings, suggesting that achieving sustainability at scale remains a significant challenge. In contrast, gender diversity on corporate boards emerges as a robust positive predictor of ESG ratings, highlighting the essential role of inclusive governance in enhancing sustainability outcomes. Contrary to expectations, the study finds no significant direct impact of board diligence and digital transformation on ESG outcomes, suggesting the need for a critical reassessment of these factors within existing sustainability frameworks. By identifying key drivers and uncovering unexpected findings, this research contributes to the ongoing discourse on ESG practices, offering valuable insights for policymakers, corporate leaders, and stakeholders committed to advancing sustainable business practices.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of the UK Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) 350 firms during 2007 to 2018, this study examines the relationship between EPU and the ESG disclosure and the moderating effects of board centrality and board political connections using multivariate regression analysis. Findings: The results show that firms tend to increase their ESG disclosure when EPU rises. The results also reveal that EPU is negatively associated with firms’ financial performance and ESG performance is less evident for firms with higher ESG disclosure scores and is observed only when board centrality is relatively low and the political connections are absent. The study finds further evidence to support the hypotheses during periods of heightened conflicts (i.e. global financial crisis and the Brexit referendum). Practical implications: This study offers practical insights for corporate managers who attempt to preserve and enhance their firms’ competitive advantages via maintaining its stakeholders support through greater ESG disclosure during heightened EPU periods. Originality/value: By integrating the resource-based view (RBV) and the signaling theory, this study extends the signaling theory and RBV by examining the relationship between EPU and ESG disclosure as a signal to its stakeholders and information advantages that board centrality and political connections bring to the company to reduce information asymmetry between the firms and its stakeholders during EPU. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Fundamental principles of agency theory and incentive mechanisms suggest that executive compensation should align with a company’s developmental goals. This paper aims to explore whether the executive compensation of listed companies in the Chinese capital market aligns with their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) practices, and the underlying mechanisms of this influence. For the first time, this study integrates ESG practices with executive compensation, creating a novel analytical framework and filling a gap in the existing literature. Employing empirical research methods such as the PSM-DID (Propensity Score Matching – Difference-in-differences) model, fixed effects model, heterogeneity analysis, and tests for mediating effects, the study concludes that ESG practices of Chinese listed companies significantly increase executive compensation, demonstrating consistency between the two. Additionally, the beneficial impact of ESG practices on executive compensation incentives is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises compared to non-state-owned ones. Financial performance, company reputation, and investor relations partially mediate the relationship between a company’s ESG practices and executive compensation. Specifically, financial performance acts as a negative mediator, while company reputation and investor relations serve as positive mediators. Initially, participation in ESG practices tends to exacerbate ‘income inequality’ between executives and other employees. However, as companies continue to enhance their ESG practice levels, this ‘income inequality’ gradually diminishes. Finally, the paper offers several suggestions: Firstly, Chinese listed companies can attract and retain top executive talents by strengthening ESG practices. Although initial ESG practices may lead to pay imbalances, long-term involvement will help reduce this disparity. Secondly, investors can conduct a more comprehensive assessment of a company’s future performance, governance structure, and corporate social responsibility by analyzing how ESG practices are reflected in executive compensation. Lastly, the paper provides valuable insights for policymakers, suggesting that regulators should develop more targeted policies and guidelines based on the relationship between a company’s ESG practices and executive compensation. © The Author(s) 2024.},

We are also the first to analyze the three individual components of ESG rankings to estimate the relative preferences of institutional investors. Research Findings/Insights: Using a unique panel dataset covering US companies and institutional investor portfolios over the 2010–2019 period, we find that while investors are driven to add high-quality ESG companies to their portfolios, there is a negative relationship with ESG when it comes to taking large ownership stakes. Furthermore, ESG scores are negatively related to the portfolio weightings of institutional investors, which raises concerns of greenwashing. Our analysis of individual ESG scores points to significantly larger effects of G scores in terms of holdings, and G is the only score with no negative impact on portfolio weightings. Finally, in support of systematic stewardship theory, top institutional investors allocate higher proportions of their portfolios to firms with high-ESG ratings. Our results are robust to the use of a difference-in-differences analysis addressing endogeneity concerns. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The findings in this paper offer important policy implications for institutional investors, managers, and policymakers. Given the ongoing debate on ESG scores, this paper shows the importance of examining greenwashing for investors who have a concern regarding the extent to which the valuation of assets might be influenced by unsupported sustainability claims. In addition, our study adds to the debate regarding ESG investing and stewardship theory. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The aim of this study is to furnish a thorough overview of existing research on the impact of ESG on firm risk and financial performance. We present a systematic literature review of recent published articles. To this end, 35 articles on ESG and firm risk and 120 articles on ESG and financial performance from January 2013 to September 2023 were reviewed. Findings reveal, first, research on the impact of ESG on firm risk and financial performance is increasingly gaining attention. Second, most of the research themes focus on idiosyncratic risk, systematic risk, stock price crash risk and default risk, while market-based and accounting-based financial performance is almost evenly split. Third, scholars have used diverse research methods but most of them use fixed effects of panel model. Moreover, scholars have not reached a consensus conclusion on this topic. For East Asia and ASEAN countries, the research methods employed are not yet sufficiently diverse. This paper comprehensively summarizes the research methods and subdivisions on this topic. This explores research gaps and provides insights for future research. In addition, this study provides a reference for East Asia and ASEAN countries to achieve sustainable economic growth and development. Copyright Author (s) 2024 },

	abstract = {Against the backdrop of driving global economic sustainability, corporate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance has gradually emerged as a crucial theoretical and practical concern. This study aims to enrich the theoretical understanding of the correlation between corporate governance and ESG. Notably, the theoretical contribution is based on the relational contract theory, indicating the significance of the informal structure and implicit characteristics of the board of directors for corporate ESG performance. Using Chinese listed firms as samples, this study empirically examines and reveals a positive correlation between the informal board hierarchy and corporate ESG performance. Moreover, based on theoretical deduction, this study identifies internal control, innovation efficiency, and financial performance as important mechanisms through which the informal board hierarchy promotes corporate ESG performance. Further analysis indicates that in firms characterized by higher board interaction, lower shareholding concentration, and the combination of the roles of chairman and CEO, the promoting effect of the informal hierarchy on corporate ESG becomes significantly more pronounced. Our findings contribute to the understanding of relational contract theory in the field of corporate sustainability, enriching the literature on corporate governance and ESG, and providing decision-making references and practical insights for optimizing corporate development. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {According to traditional portfolio theories constraints, restrictions, and screens applied in portfolio selection reduces the diversification opportunities which can impact financial performance. Is this true in the case of socially responsible investment (SRI)? To answer this, present study analyzes the performance of Socially Responsible (SR) indices in comparison to conventional indices in an emerging economy. The uniqueness of the study is that it analyses the performance of Shariah, ESG, and thematic indices in a single study. Further, the study measures the impact of Covid-19 on them. Comparative performance evaluation was conducted by using absolute return analysis and risk-adjusted measures namely, Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, tracking error, information ratio, capital asset pricing model (CAPM), Fama–French three-factor, and Carhart's four-factor models. The Structural break was identified, hence analysis was conducted for the total period (January 2017–March 2023) and two sub-periods, that is, pre and post-Covid-19 period. No significant difference was found between the returns of SR indices and conventional indices as against the benchmark index on the basis of absolute return analysis. Sharpe ratio and Treynor ratio both were having negative values for all the SR and conventional indices. Tracking error for all the SR and Conventional indices were very low. The CAPM and both multi-factor models univocally pointed toward the underperformance of all the SR (except S&P BSE 100 ESG index which had equal performance) and both conventional indices against the benchmark index. Noteworthy point is that only Shariah indices gave the highest returns during post-Covid period. This research will help in deepening the SRI in the capital market. Companies should increase their ESG scores and make efforts to be listed on the SR indices. Policymakers should announce some kind of rebates, or recognition for star-performing companies in the field of sustainability to encourage other companies to adopt SR practices in their business operations. The novelty of the current study is that it adds to the socially responsible literature by analyzing the performance of Shariah, ESG, and Thematic indices and conventional indices in a single study in the fastest-growing economy of India and analyses the impact of Covid-19 on this performance. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The study finds that environmental, social, and governance disclosures significantly influence the Return on Equity and Return on Assets. Testing for the moderating role of Corporate Governance, especially board diversity and size, shows that board diversity moderates the association between social and governance disclosure and firm performance. Board size moderates the relationship between social disclosure and firm performance. By contrast, Board Size and Diversity do not moderate the relationship between environmental disclosure and firm performance.

	abstract = {Purpose: With corporate social responsibility (CSR) becoming mandatory, several firms in India have been compelled into spending resources on CSR while their business strategy and processes were unprepared to take up CSR activities, effectively. In this light, the CSR relationship with other business functions would be altered. Using Thomson Reuters data from 2010 to 2018 (pre-mandate to post-mandate) this study aims to re-examine the relationship between CSR and financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: The current study is rooted in the bandwagon-bias effect theory and uses a long-term data (2010–2018) of Indian firms. It uses Refinitiv Thomson Reuters ESG rating to measure CSR and accounting measures for financial performance (FP) to make a pre-post analysis of the impact that mandatory CSR regime has had on firms performance. The study uses the weighted panel regression method. Findings: The relationship between CSR and FP is different when CSR was voluntary than when it has been mandated by Law. CSR has a positive effect over the FP during the voluntary phase but this positive relationship weakens during the mandatory phase. The waning effect of CSR over FP substantiates the presence of bandwagon bias effect which can be explained by the crowding-in of several companies engaged in CSR activities because of the mandatory CSR law. Research limitations/implicationsv: Few countries have made CSR mandatory therefore CSR literature is limited. But mandating CSR is a growing phenomenon so this study augments to the body of knowledge. Until now literature generally converged on a positive relationship between CSR performance and FP but the current study shows altering directions to this relationship in a changing CSR environment. The use of the bandwagon-bias theory contributes to the theoretical approaches. Theoretically, the findings add to the body CSR literature and offer impetus to the evolving domain of impact measurement and reporting. Practical implications: Results of the study offer a clear indication to managers that they need to re-strategise their CSR activities during the mandatory CSR environment if they wish to draw instrumental benefits of a positive impact on the FP of their firms. CSR expenditure is now a leveller so managers may either exceed the mandatory 2% expenditure as some firms did during the voluntary CSR phase or else design their CSR implementation plans to bring about a more impactful positive change. Communicating the impact of CSR to influential and powerful stakeholders beyond the mandatory reporting to the government is yet another way through which managers can draw benefits of CSR activities. Additionally to draw positive results from CSR activities firms may consider adopting international reporting and benchmarking standards such as the GRI and ISO 26000. Finally, the results of the study can be used by policymakers to make a note that the CSR law is causing a weakening of the financial benefits and therefore. Social implications: The results of the study can be used by policymakers also need to make a note that the CSR law is causing a weakening of the financial benefits and therefore firms are adopting shortcuts, by donating the required amount of funds. But donation of funds defeats the real purpose of mandatory CSR which is social impact, therefore the regulators may want to make the necessary changes unplug the gaps in the CSR law to ensure better adherence to the law in spirit and a real impact on the ground activities. Originality/value: While CSR–FP relationship has been extensively explored but limited studies have explored this relationship in a mandatory CSR environment and no other work presents a comparative view of the CSR–FP relationship, namely, before and after the mandatory CSR policy. The current study is one of the limited few studying the impact of mandatory CSR policy on FP, and the only one that uses the bandwagon-bias effect to explain the phenomenon of weakening impact of CSR on FP of firms. Bandwagon-bias effect has been used in studying consumer behaviour, where group effect impacts behaviour of individuals and with mandatory CSR policy, firms following the other firms leading to crowding in. Using the bandwagon-bias effect has found limited attention from the CSR scholars, the current study uses this theoretical basis and therefore augments the CSR literature. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study aims to examine the impact of the sustainability of business models of the largest Ukrainian enterprises on their financial results in the period before the military conflict started. This study tested the hypothesis that in the Ukrainian context, corporate sustainability and transparency have an insignificant positive impact on the efficiency of the implementation of business models of enterprises. The author’s methodology made it possible to assess the sustainability of the business models of 40 enterprises by calculating an integral indicator for 21 areas with significant ESG issues and classify enterprises according to the levels of sustainability and efficiency of their business models using a specially developed scale. Correlation and regression analyses were used to quantify the degree of influence of corporate sustainability and transparency. The results of the analyses demonstrated a weak positive correlation between financial results and sustainability and transparency indicators, which emphasizes the need to develop a unified methodology to assess corporate sustainability for Ukrainian enterprises that can be adapted for countries with transition economies and similar political landscapes. This study makes a theoretical contribution by proposing an approach to assessing corporate sustainability based on integral indicators. This article is of interest to stakeholders involved in sustainable development, outlines directions for further research to support socially responsible business practices of enterprises, and emphasizes the need for further empirical research on factors affecting corporate sustainability and transparency. © 2024 by the authors.},

Although sentiment acts most of the time as a net receiver of shocks, notably during the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical crises, it sometimes becomes a net sender of shocks. Furthermore, the spillovers between sentiment and ESG volatility are determined mainly by the long-term component, especially during extreme events, implying the persistence of shock transmission due to high uncertainty. The results also illustrate the impact of market conditions on the spillovers between sentiment and ESG volatility.

Particularly in regions beset by crises, enterprises find themselves at the forefront of efforts to develop resilience and stability. Leveraging insights from information effect theory and stakeholder theory, this study delves into an intricate interplay to unveil the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance on corporate solvency. In particular, the study investigates how ESG considerations influence short-term and long-term solvency metrics. Utilizing data from the listed constituent enterprises of the Stock Exchange of Thailand Sustainability Index (SETTHSI) during 2015 – 2023, the findings reveal a positive correlation between ESG performance and solvency at current levels, with no significant lag effect. Further analysis suggests that higher-polluting firms exhibit a stronger correlation between ESG performance and solvency compared to their non or lower-polluting counterparts. The findings remain robust across various assessments encompassing heterogeneity analysis by implementing group regressions and testing for endogeneity using the Propensity Score Matching approach, ensuring the reliability and applicability of the results which underscores the practical significance and theoretical relevance of the study, with profound implications for long-term enterprise resilience and broader social advancement. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Using the ESG scores from the Bloomberg Database and the manually filtered green fund investor data, we study the influence of green fund investors on the Chinese A-shares' ESG performance. As we have found, the holding of fund investors who pay attention to sustainable development can improve the firm's ESG performance, and this improvement is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises, heavily polluting industries, and after the green policy announcement. Our findings are robust after considering the reverse causality endogeneity concern and sample selection bias. In addition, the holdings of green fund investors favor the company's status as a green index constituent and its long-term financial performance. Further, the mechanism test reveals the influencing channel of this improvement and supports that it is long-term green fund investors themselves improving the firms' ESG performance and can improve a firm's ESG performance by attracting other long-term investors and new mutual fund investors, and increasing the level of media scrutiny pressure. Our paper contributes to figuring out the impact of institutional holding on ESG development and further points out the source of this influence. © 2024},

In addition, this study explores whether the R&D investments and the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosure play a mediating role over the association between GI and accounting-based and market-based financial performance, respectively. Based on a sample of 526 firms over the period 2012–2022, we find that GI is negatively associated with accounting-based financial performance and positively associated with market-based financial performance. We further find that GI impacts on accounting-based financial performance via the channel of R&D investments and on market-based financial performance via the channel of ESG disclosure. This study provides useful contributions to prior research by encouraging the adoption of an integrated perspective when evaluating potential effects of GI. This study can also assist managers in better preparing for the challenges of implementing GI by leveraging the ESG disclosure. It also advices to investors to carefully assess the more complex impact of GI on financial performance of the firm within their capital allocation decision-making process. In the same vein, it offers some insights to policy makers interested in facilitating the transition to a sustainable economy. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The benefits of sustainability reporting are indisputable. These include, first and foremost, building trust. Transparency on non-financial performance can help reduce reputational risk and open a dialogue with stakeholders. Transparent sustainability reporting is also a sign of openness and responsibility. Efforts to develop the economy sustainably include the development of reporting concepts in this sphere. Sustainability activities are becoming an increasingly important element of business reports. This article aims to present and verify the current sustainability reporting at the level of comparison of reported indicators of selected automotive companies in the context of the most widely used Global Reporting Initiative systematics and the upcoming requirements defined by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). It focuses on study cases and identifies good practices and difficulties of sustainable reporting in the automotive industry. This study used the case study method on selected automotive industry companies. The case study analyses a defined problem consisting of a real situation and information as a methodological tool. The findings show that the world’s major automotive companies are broadly endeavouring to realise sustainability practices. The main conclusion of the analysis is that the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), in addition to being complementary, can be combined not only to improve the strategic management of an organisation but also, in a broader context, serve the well-being of the local community and society at large. The article organises and systematises knowledge about the ESG concept and the GRI standard, which currently play an important role in sustainability reporting. © 2024 A. Kamińska-Witkowska and M.

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) is an indicator that measures the non-financial performance of an enterprise; this article takes listed companies in China’s textile industry from 2015 to 2022 as a research sample and utilizes a bi-directional fixed-effect model that controls for time and individuals to empirically analyze the relationship between ESG performance and corporate total factor productivity (TFP). The results show the following: (1) the better the corporate ESG performance, the higher the TFP; (2) the mechanism test results show that corporate ESG performance promotes TFP by improving green innovation capacity and enhancing corporate human capital, and green innovation and human capital play a partially mediating role; (3) the moderation test shows that agency costs play a weakening role in ESG performance, positively affecting corporate total factor productivity; (4) the heterogeneity analyses found that enterprises are more significantly affected by ESG among non-state-owned enterprises and in the central region. The results of the study provide empirical evidence to guide textile enterprises to actively fulfill ESG performance to enhance enterprise total factor productivity and achieve high quality and sustainable development. © 2024 by the authors.},

The purpose of this study is to develop and apply a comprehensive methodology for assessing ESG risks of construction companies taking into account financial indicators. Due to the limited availability of ESG data of Russian construction firms, the methodology was tested on hypothetical companies X, Y and Z, which allowed to demonstrate the assessment process and identify the potential of the methodology for practical application. The study collected and normalized data on environmental, social and governance factors, as well as financial indicators, using weighting factors to reflect the relative importance of each indicator. The results showed significant diff erences between companies, identifying areas for improvement and providing customized recommendations to improve their ESG performance and financial sustainability. The methodology proved to be effective even with limited data availability, offering a valuable tool for companies and investors to assess and improve ESG practices in the construction sector. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

	abstract = {We investigate the joint effect of competitive strategies and the pay gap on ESG performance. We employ the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive the two competitive strategies, namely product differentiation and cost leadership. Based on data from firms listed in S&P1500 from 2000 to 2022, and using the Three Stage Least Square (3SLS) model, we hypothesize and find that cost leadership companies have a negative relationship with ESG performance, and the pay gap exacerbates this negative relationship. In contrast, we predict and find that product differentiation companies have a positive relationship with ESG performance, and the pay gap makes this positive relationship more pronounced. Overall, we contribute to the literature and managerial practices in three ways. First, we contribute to the literature on the pay gap by considering the company's competitive strategy, an important variable that previous studies tend to ignore. The findings of our study suggest that researchers need to consider competitive strategy when investigating the relationship between the pay gap and ESG performance. Second, our study uses ESG performance rather than financial performance as the dependent variable. As such, our study contributes to the limited literature on the relationship between the pay gap and ESG performance. Finally, for practice, our study sheds an important light on understanding the strategic reasons underlying managers’ motivation to invest in ESG activities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

This gap is crucial given the increasing focus on ESG in mining operations and its potential impact on company performance. Based on proprietary financial and ESG ratings data from 200 mining companies, this study investigates the relationship between two different ESG ratings and firm characteristics. We compare ESG-rated firms with unrated firms in terms of firm size, and financial performance indicators, and explore country-level patterns in ESG ratings. Findings reveal that ESG-rated mining companies are generally larger than unrated firms but neither more profitable nor face lower debt costs. The results also show that, among rated firms, larger mining firms have more favorable ESG ratings than smaller ones. However, we fail to find a correlation between ESG ratings and financial performance. Finally, the evidence suggests that mining companies rated high for unmanaged ESG risk are likely to have lower ESG scores. This research contributes to understanding whether and how ESG ratings could impact investment decisions and risk management strategies in the mining sector. © 2024 The Author(s)},

Through this lens, the current study seeks to explore the impact of ESG reporting on the direct and interaction impact of board diversity on green innovation in the context of a developed economy like the U.S. A total of 334 non-financial companies listed in the S&P 1500 Index were sampled for the period 2010 to 2021. Results of the study revealed that ESG rating has a significant and positive impact on the environmental pillar (EPS) and innovation scores (EIS). In addition, the CSR strategy score also has a positive relationship with EPS. Furthermore, board diversity positively impacts the relationship between ESG score, EPS, and EIS. Findings indicate that ESG reporting in U.S. firms improves green revenues, product innovation, and R&D activities aimed at promoting green innovation practices. Secondly, the CSR score also positively contributes to green innovation. Larger social and environmental practices (CSR) in US companies indicate higher eco-efficiency and implementation of clean technologies. In addition, board diversity in the US firms fosters green innovation through investments in green technologies and manufacturing eco-designed products. Based on our research findings, this study supports the stakeholder theory, a resource-based view, and the Upper-echelon theory. © 2024 The Author(s)},

This paper examines the inner influence mechanisms of digital finance on ESG (environmental, social, and governance) and financial performance. The results show digital finance is conducive to ESG performance while indirectly enhancing firms’ short- and long-term financial performance via ESG. Further, digital finance usage depth is the primary enabler for ESG and short-term financial performance. The mechanism analysis reveals that the positive relationship between digital finance and ESG will be enhanced by upgrading green innovation and boosting digital transformation. Moreover, heterogeneous analysis states that digital finance usage depth has a more pronounced positive role on ESG and financial performance in large firms and SOEs (state-owned enterprises) while coverage breadth positively affects ESG and is more pronounced in small firms and non-SOEs.

New terminologies such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores address this issue and responsibility. This study investigates the impact of sustainability (environment (ENV), social (SOC), governance (GOV), and ESG) on the financial performance of firms in the fast-moving consumer goods industry from 2013 to 2020, the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (SCKP). The study sample covers 113 firms in the North American region (the USA and Canada did not participate in SCKP). The results showed that ESG is not an influencer of financial performance, while ENV and SOC components negatively affect financial performance. On the other hand, GOV is the most significant influencer that positively impacts financial performance. Based on these findings, ESG and its components are not conducive to promoting financial performance during the SCKP period. However, fast-moving consumer goods are ahead of other sectors in terms of sustainability disclosure. Moreover, the highest positive impact of GOV is attributed to the advanced system with rules, standards, and regulations that foster the better and more efficient governance of firms from developed countries. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study is designed to conduct a systematic literature review aimed at assessing the influence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance on firm value. Although previous studies have explored their relationship, a comprehensive systematic review on this topic is still lacking. We conducted a detailed literature search in the Scopus and Web of Science databases and identified 73 papers published between 2016 and 2023 as the sample, covering annual trends, country and industry distribution, theoretical frameworks, proxy variables, research methods, research results, and provided direction for future research. We found a significant increase in the number of studies over the past 3 years. Cross-country studies dominated the field, with most research adopting multi-industry analysis, while studies focusing on a single industry were relatively rare. The stakeholder theory and agency theory were the most widely applied theories. Most studies showed that ESG performance had a positive effect on firm value, reflecting the growing importance that markets and investors placed on ESG performance and its contribution to long-term firm growth. However, some studies reported negative or insignificant effects, noting that the effects of ESG performance varied by industry, region, and market environment. This study suggests that future research should explore the independent and interactive effects of each ESG dimension on firm value, focusing on dynamic relationships across industries and regions, using new methods and models, and incorporating moderating variables. This study provides practical guidance for firm managers and policymakers to optimize ESG practices, enhancing firm value and promoting sustainability. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this research paper is to analyze the connection between ESG performance and financial performance within the real estate sector. By focusing on ESG ratings and pillar scores as proxies for ESG performance, the study investigates how these factors impact both profitability and market indicators. Design/methodology/approach: With data sourced from over 680 publicly listed real estate companies, the research employs a fixed effects regression model to analyze the findings. By utilizing this method, the study can assess the impact of governance, environmental and social factors on both the accounting and market performance of real estate companies. Findings: The outcomes of this study underscore a link between sustainability, particularly environmental aspects and financial performance. However, the study also reveals a contrasting result: governance factors are associated with adverse financial outcomes. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight the limitations as the results present a mixed picture with limited significant findings. Practical implications: Companies should prioritize improvements in environment to boost profitability, while they should carefully consider the costs and benefits associated with enhancing their governance structure. Originality/value: By focusing on this industry and adopting a global perspective, the study addresses a gap in the literature. The research’s innovative approach to utilizing ESG ratings and pillar scores as proxies for ESG performance enhances its originality. Furthermore, the research’s identification of the differing impacts of environmental and governance factors on financial outcomes add novel perspectives to the discourse. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Applying a multi-theoretical framework, we employ correlation analysis and univariate and multiple linear regressions to assess the relationships. Our findings reveal positive correlations between climate governance and the presence of a climate transition plan, MSCI ratings, DJSI membership, and the existence of a sustainability executive. Additionally, companies located in developed countries exhibit significantly higher levels of climate change governance. These results hold across various scenarios, offering valuable insights for researchers, academics, business leaders, practitioners, and regulators.

	abstract = {Today's business world must address the critical issue of sustainability as it is associated with an organization's comprehensive strategy. In response to the increasing focus on 'sustainable' issues, corporations are now disclosing more information about their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities. Most business leaders are becoming more conscious of the importance of ESG concerns outside of their financial results, which could affect a company's capacity to maintain its financial stability and reputation as a trusted brand. This research paper collects the ESG scores of Indian companies included in the NIFTY 50 for the financial year 2021-2022 from CRISIL and investigates the relationship between ESG scores and financial attributes of companies using a correlation matrix and multiple regression analysis. The findings indicate a positive relationship between profitability and ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) with overall ESG disclosure scores and environmental disclosure scores, followed by the companies' governance and social disclosure scores. The study emphasizes the rising need to implement ESG factors in business strategies and investment decisions. It implies that sustainable practices are more than just compliance or corporate responsibility; they can also be an important driver of financial success. Companies must strike a balance between expansion and ethical ESG policies to prevent negative consequences. Additionally, investors and other stakeholders could use ESG scores to manage risks to identify companies with greater potential for long-term resilience and sustainability. The results from cluster analysis and sector-wise share of disclosure scores depict that the information technology sector and the fast-moving consumer goods sector disclose more information on ESG aspects. The study also reveals that not all industrial sectors perform similarly in ESG aspects, providing valuable insights for investors to identify sectors that are inconsistent with their investment plan. In addition, firms can ascertain their ESG performance gaps, enabling them to develop customized sustainability strategies that address industry-specific boundaries. © 2024 SCMS Group of Educational Institutions.

Using estimates of the firms' ex ante cost of equity capital, we examine its relationship with industry-relative measures of the firms' CSP, its environmental and social pillars and sub-pillars. We find that increased overall CSP reduces a firm's cost of equity capital up until a point, beyond which the marginal benefits of further CSP investment decrease. We find that the social pillar is the main driver of the reductions in cost of capital, in particular, a firm's performance in relation to its workforce, and that higher performance is increasingly rewarded with a lower cost of capital. Finally, we find that this relationship differs depending on the institutional context, with greater reductions in the cost of capital evident in countries with stronger institutional environments. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {This research examines the hypotheses that macroeconomic variables and environmental factors impact credit risk. This study focuses on the relationship between macroeconomics, environmental issues, and credit risk in ASEAN countries. This study applies a panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to data from the World Bank for the 2008-2019 period. The variables studied include non-performing loans (NPLs), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, interest rates, inflation, and carbon emissions. The research results show that environmental factors do not affect NPLs, while macroeconomic factors do. GDP growth and inflation reduce NPLs while rising credit interest rates increase NPLs. The results imply credit risk is not considered sustainable lending. Credit risk does not consider environmental degradation as measured by increases in carbon emissions. From cross-country evidence, the effect of environmental degradation on credit quality is not found in all countries. Indeed, if environmental quality is considered, environmental degradation will be detrimental to operational and financial performance, especially for heavily polluting firms. However, poor ecological quality will harm operational and financial performance. In addition, business entities within the framework of sustainable loans have collateral consequences for business activities aimed at reducing pollution, which has implications for increasing costs. For decision-makers, both regulators and banks, in the future, banking credit distribution must seriously consider implementing sustainable lending through green credit policy schemes. Green credit schemes need to involve collaboration with banks and incorporate environmental factors into the loan portfolio. Empirically implementing green credit can improve bank financial performance and firm environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Copyright: © 2024 The authors.},

Due to the quasi-public product perspective of green innovation, the performance of enterprises as a result of green innovation activities exhibits significant heterogeneity. This heterogeneity exists not only between corporate value and financial performance but also among individual enterprises. This paper is based on a sample of 1510 listed Chinese companies examined from 2013 to 2020 and uses machine learning algorithms and quasi-natural experiments to precisely estimate the causal relationship and mechanisms between green innovation and corporate performance. The findings elucidate several critical aspects of green innovation within the corporate sphere: Firstly, rather than attracting green incentives from financial markets, green innovation activities inadvertently stifle the enhancement of corporate value. Secondly, these activities markedly bolster corporate financial performance, primarily by diminishing operational costs, which in turn elevates the return on assets (ROA). Lastly, of all corporate characteristics examined, enterprise size and equity concentration stand out as key determinants influencing the variability in outcomes of green innovation performance. The above findings provide information on the significant implications of enhancing green technology innovation systems and green incentive mechanisms. © 2024 by the authors.},

From an out-of-sample empirical experiment, we observe that this optimization technique provides much more stable optimal weights for the sustainable portfolio than for the traditional one. Based on both classical and downside-risk performance measures, active management in both portfolios outperforms the global market index. In this context, the non-inclusion of skewness and kurtosis leads to an underestimation of actual risk exposure.

Contrary to expectations, firms opted to reduce their debt exposure during the pandemic. Tobin’s Q was the most significant determinant of capital structure, as it mitigated total debt by 0.25% during the pandemic. This result aligns with the pecking order theory, suggesting that firms prefer internal financing over debt. Simultaneously, combined scores (ESG) and the decomposed environment (E), social (S), and governance (G) scores individually and paired with the COVID-19 dummy negatively affected short-term debt by 0.012%, 0.015%, 0.0068%, and 0.00434%, respectively. This study’s results highlight the significance of firms adopting less debt-heavy policies during periods of heightened uncertainty to effectively manage financial risk.

	abstract = {This study delves into the intricate relationship between corporate governance factors, including board size and the proportion of non-executive directors, and firm performance, with a specialized focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations. Employing a secondary data analysis methodology, the research draws insights from a comprehensive dataset comprising 100 companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange over a period spanning from 2018 to 2022. The study investigates these relationships using rigorous regression analysis to uncover significant findings. The analysis reveals a robust positive correlation between larger board sizes and firm performance, indicating that companies with expanded boards tend to exhibit improved financial performance within the Pakistani market landscape. Conversely, a higher proportion of non-executive directors is associated with decreased performance, highlighting potential challenges stemming from board composition. Furthermore, the research unveils the pivotal role of ESG practices in augmenting the positive relationship between board size and firm performance. However, it notes that this enhancement weakens as the proportion of non-executive director’s increases, suggesting a nuanced interplay between corporate governance structures and ESG considerations. Practically, the study underscores the critical importance of fostering diverse and well-structured boards while integrating ESG principles into corporate governance frameworks. By carefully considering board composition and embracing ESG practices, organizations can not only enhance their financial performance but also promote sustainability and long-term value creation, aligning with evolving stakeholder expectations and regulatory requirements in the Pakistani business landscape. © 2024 Conscientia Beam.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to empirically examine environment, social, and governance (ESG) as an effective strategy to reduce major impediments for a corporation in the form of costs of capital (COC) and systematic risk, especially for emerging markets such as India. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 114 Indian firms from eight prominent industries based on Thomson Reuters classification (TRBC) are used in the study. A panel regression with industry-fixed effects is carried out to account for industry heterogeneity. For robustness, the authors also carry out a matched sample analysis. Findings: The authors observe a negative and significant relationship between ESG performance with COC and systematic risk, respectively. For the pillar-wise analysis, the authors observe that only governance performance is negatively and significantly related to COC whereas the environmental and social performances are negative and insignificant. For ESG pillar level analysis for beta, the authors observe that all pillars are negative and significant, thus making a case for how firms can fine-tune their ESG strategies according to each pillar. Research limitations/implications: As the ESG concept is still in a very nascent stage, data availability is a definite challenge in India. Practical implications: As ESG is increasingly becoming relevant for multiple stakeholders, this study aims to provide evidence that can potentially guide the regulators, practitioners, and academicians to address the contemporary needs of these stakeholders, while also doing good for the firm in the traditional sense. Social implications: The transition to a sustainable economy is a challenge for emerging economies, especially for a country like India where stakeholders are not only varied but also huge in number. With this study's contribution towards an incremental understanding of ESG, Indian regulators and policymakers can bring forward mandates as to ESG compliances that are rewarding for the firms and give them enough impetus towards complying with ESG norms. Originality/value: The extant literature on ESG majorly discusses the relationship between ESG performance and financial performance.

The importance of environmental protection has gained attention in recent years, as proliferation in ESG rating agencies has significantly increased. As suggested by stakeholder theory, the corporations for their survival are required to take care of the environment in which they operate. We used a sample of 245 non-financial publicly listed firms of developing economy, Pakistan, from 2007 to 2019, to examine whether firms that engage in environmental protection activities have lower operating risk than firms that do not. We identified four important dimensions based on previous literature, to develop a unique index for measuring the firms' environmental performance. These dimensions included voluntary standardization, product environmental compliance, process environmental compliance, and environmental social drives. Focused on downside operating risk in terms of firm operating income, we used binary codes to distinguish firms that are negatively deviating from their industrial average. Using logistic regression on our hand-collected environmental performance index data, this study finds that firms maintaining effective environmental protection activities are less likely to experience operational failure compared to peers who do not. This relationship holds true even after controlling for various firm-specific factors such as firm size, leverage, growth opportunity, and profitability. Our findings have implications for policymakers and corporate managers who seek to improve their firms' environmental and financial performance simultaneously. By highlighting the potential benefits of corporate environmental protection efforts, our study provides valuable insights for firms operating in emerging economies. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The authors use a manually constructed index based on the most current 2019 ESG Reporting Guide launched by HKEX, followed by quantitative statistical methods using a model that follows the valuation framework by Ohlson. Findings: The authors find a significant positive association between total ESG disclosure level and firm financial performance in the main tests. However, when the total ESG scores are partitioned into environmental and social subscores, the results show that only social disclosures are value relevant. Moreover, the results demonstrate that environmental and social subscores are both significant when return on assets (ROA) is used as a dependent variable. Furthermore, the robustness tests show that only qualitative ESG information is value relevant to share prices, while both quantitative and qualitative ESG information are relevant to ROA.

The study findings indicate that ESG performance exerts a positive influence on CFP by fostering corporate innovation. Corporations with good ESG performance in the long term may be more conducive to good CFP. When corporations face financial constraints, the role of ESG performance in enhancing CFP weakens. Heterogeneity analyses indicate that ESG performance contributes more to the CFP of non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs). The negative moderating influence of financial constraints is more pronounced in non-SOEs. Additionally, ESG performance promotes the improvement of CFP in non-heavy polluting corporates.

	abstract = {Corporate hypocrisy poses a significant risk to businesses striving for sustainable management. Stakeholders' increasing interest in ESG (environmental, social, and governance) activities and easy access to information makes maintaining authenticity essential. Any firm caught in hypocrisy risks losing stakeholder trust and damaging its legitimacy. Family firms willing to preserve socioemotional wealth are more susceptible to hypocrisy than general firms due to the family's significant influence on decision-making, including CEO (chief executive officer) turnover and legitimacy crises. This study examined the impact of CSIR (corporate social irresponsibility) on sustainability in two South Korean companies and assessed how internal factors (e.g., CEO turnover and succession) and external factors (e.g., market competition and environmental dynamism) influenced them. To this end, we employed a case study as the central methodology and conducted text mining, interviews, and financial analysis through content analysis. Our first finding is that CSIR negatively affects financial and non-financial performance in family firms. Second, family firms must make genuine efforts to restore their legitimacy. As per the moderation effect of CEO succession, the pivotal consideration is appointing an external CEO rather than whether the subsequent CEO is a family member. Beta chose an external CEO who was a family member, while Alpha selected a long-time company insider who was not a family member as the succeeding CEO. Alpha, which designated an internal nonfamily CEO after the CEO succession, demonstrated a financial performance resilience inferior to Beta. Third, firms must communicate promptly with stakeholders in external conditions. With internationalization and digitalization, stakeholders enjoy a greater array of choices, and the evolution of public media has heightened the prominence of CSIR. The diminishing reliance of stakeholders on a particular company, the active articulation of opinions, and enhanced knowledge magnify the impact of a company's CSIR on the sustainability of family firms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Identifying factors affecting financial performance evaluation in today's competitive markets. This study investigates the effect of sustainability reporting on financial performance evaluation. The panel data method is used considering the data type and the available analysis methods. The required data is collected through document analysis and referring to databases, and inferential statistics are used to conclude. The statistical population of this study includes all companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) during the period 2012-2021. The panel data regression model tests the research hypotheses, and the Stata software (Version 14) is employed to analyze the data. The results indicate that the three measures of corporate financial performance (return on assets, return on equity, and economic value added) are favorably affected by sustainability reporting. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that companies with a sustainable approach to environmental, social, and governance (hereafter ESG) issues build the trust and confidence of investors, creditors, and shareholders, which leads to an increase in firm value and, ultimately, the improvement of corporate performance. Using the results of this study, investors and creditors can identify and invest in companies that take sustainable ESG actions, which leads to an increase in their return on investment. © Mehdi Ershadi, Zohreh Hajiha, Mozhgan Safa, Hossein Moghadam.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many companies obtain financing by improving their ESG scores. This inevitably affects the financial performance of enterprises. We provide a view that companies should balance non-financial and financial performance rather than only increasing ESG scores. High ESG score companies that are not profitable will not perform well in the market. By applying the coupling coordination model (CCM) and China's listed firm data from 2010 to 2022, we assess the coupling coordination between ESG and financial performance among listed companies in China. We found that the overall level of corporate coupling coordination in China is not high, locating at the transitional stage. East, the Yangtze River Economic Belt, the Chengdu-Chongqing City Group, and foreign firms have a higher level of coupling coordination. Northeast, Yellow River Basin, and private enterprises perform poorly. Coupling coordination is higher for firms that are larger, more capital intensive, and more socially responsible. From the decomposition results, improving corporate coupling coordination needs to focus on enhancing the E (environmental) score and S (social) score in the non-financial performance, as well as the growth capacity and profitability in the financial performance. The innovation of this paper is that it assesses the firm's coupling coordination from the perspective of balancing ESG and financial performance. It provides a warning to firms that focus too much on ESG scores. Enterprises should avoid excessive focus on ESG that leads to poor financial performance. © 2023},

The study considered a sample of 569 listed firms, and the study period spans from 2010 to 2022. Using estimates of feasible generalized least square and quintile regression, the study finds a positive association between the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) score and the financial performance of firms. All the individual dimensions of the ESG score positively affect the firm's internal and external values. Environmental practices have the highest impact on improving balance sheet values through return on asset (ROA). In contrast, social practices have the highest impact on creating market value through Tobin's Q (TQ) compared with other dimensions. However, for large firms, excess investment in ESG may not support their balance sheet through ROA but generates market value through TQ. ESG disclosers negatively impact the internal earnings of firms that are financially inflexible but, in the aggregate, support the firm's market value. In addition, the study finds a significant moderating effect of size, earnings, value, and financial flexibility on the association between ESG scores and the financial performance of the firms. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The changes being implemented in sustainability efforts are a response to these challenges. However, the question is how these measures affect companies‘financial performance. The study aims to verify the relationship between the reporting of sustainability scores related to three aspects: environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG). It focuses on the financial performance of companies in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region in 2017-2021. The study will use panel regression and cross-sectional analysis. The results indicate a positive relationship between the disclosure of ESG activities and the financial performance of companies as measured by ROA. It was also observed that for companies operating in the financial sector, the correlation is greater, compared to companies operating in other sectors.

Hence, sustainability disclosures contribute value driver factors for firms to maximize the stakeholder's benefits. The adoption and impact of sustainability disclosure in various industries have been shown by numerous existing studies. Astonishingly, some studies lack the adoption of sustainability disclosure in the aviation industry. These impacts on FV and FP in the aviation industry have received little attention and remain largely unexplored, despite an increase in the sustainability disclosure implementation. Hence, this work will focus on the sustainability disclosure's impact on the aviation industry and explore the relationship between sustainability disclosure with FV and FP. Data have been considered from 44 airlines from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database from 2017 to 2022. A study of the result has been analyzed by utilizing multiple Regression Analysis (RA). The outcome displayed that variables of environmental and Governance Pillar Score (GS) have a positive relationship with the FP and FV in the aviation industry. Also, it revealed that the relationship between sustainability disclosure and FV and FP has been significantly moderated by the size of firms. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The modern corporation is evaluated by many measures that go beyond profit, which was the emphasis for years previously. Today’s corporation is weighed against expectations of many stakeholders, including not just customers but employees, investors, the government and even the public at large with no discernible financial or other tie to a company. As such, corporate boards necessarily must be concerned with more than financial performance, including corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the increasing emphasis on environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics. Given that public relations scholars and practitioners have long been concerned with stakeholder relationships, social responsibility and other non-financial indicators, it would make sense that public relations has a more obvious presence on corporate boards. Design/methodology/approach: This study examined the 25 companies in the Fortune Modern Board 25 to determine how many board members had a background or expertise in public relations that would contribute to the leadership necessary for the concerns of the modern corporation, and whether the boards had a committee designated to public relations or related functions. Findings: Results show that there are few corporate boards that have public relations represented prominently in either their members or committees. The same is true for executive leadership teams. Public relations or communications executives do appear to play some role in ESG, CSR and DEI reporting, but often there are staff members with those specific titles and roles. Research limitations/implications: The study was limited to 25 corporations on a Forbes list that ranked them as best in communicating ESG, CSR and DEI. The method examined publicly available literature which was revealing to the research questions, but more could be learned by interview or survey with CCOs. Practical implications: The study shows the current presence of public relations capacity in terms of members of corporate boards, corporate committees and among the C-suite is not significant. Also, rather than PR as a function owning modern concerns of DEI, ESG and CSR, there are professionals with specific expertise in those areas who are responsible for those corporate issues. Social implications: Corporate social responsibility (CSR), ESG (environmental, social, governance) and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) have recently been stressed as important for corporations to measure and report. The role of the public relations profession in managing and/or communicating in these areas is important to consider in terms of public expectations and satisfaction of communication on these subjects. Originality/value: This paper is unique in integrating public relations theory and practice with board theory and the current management concerns with ESG, CSR and DEI. Little if any previous research has considered which professions are in charge of communicating on these concerns. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The findings are as follows: (1) digital transformation of manufacturing enterprises plays a significant positive role in innovation performance, ESG performance, working capital management performance, organizational resilience, and corporate market competitiveness, and (2) digital transformation can promote the improvement of non-financial performance of manufacturing enterprises by improving the quality of internal control. In addition, the heterogeneity analysis results show that digital transformation contributes more to the non-financial performance of non-state-owned manufacturing enterprises.

	abstract = {The significance of our research is connected with the many regulations in the European Union concerning ESG issues. These documents are very often related to environmental aspects and concern banks as public trust entities. We focus on banks on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE), which constitute the main part of the Polish banking sector. We examine the relationship between financial efficiency and environmental responsibility in the banking sector. We identified three objectives for our research: first: to assess financial efficiency in the banks under study, second: to assess eco-management in banks listed on the WSE, third: to investigate whether there is a relationship between environmental responsibility as an ESG element of banks and their financial efficiency. The above objectives correspond with the research hypothesis adopted: Among the banks analysed, there is a correlation between a bank's financial performance and the Bank Ecologisation Index (BEI-2). This study refers to the period 2019-2021 to show the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic. We adopt various research methods to measure the environmental responsibility of banks and to examine the relationship between ecological engagement and banks’ financial ratios. In our research, we use descriptive statistics, linear ordering methods, standardised sum methods, synthetic measures of development, box plots, and analysis of the financial and non-financial reports of the entities analysed. The paper consists of five parts: introduction, literature review and research goals, materials and methods, results and discussion, and conclusions. Our results show that among the banks analysed, there is no statistically significant correlation between financial results and the Bank Ecologisation Index (BEI-2). This may be due to the fact that, as a result of the economic instability caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, banks in Poland have slowed down their growth potential and investments in greening have shifted to the longer-term perspective. © 2024, Wydawnictwo Ekonomia i Srodowisko.

This trend highlights the critical role of ESG factors in the financial sector. This study leverages stakeholder theory, risk management theory, and ESG investment theory, utilising financial data and ESG scores from Chinese listed banks to comprehensively analyse ESG elements and examine their impact on the liquidity risk of commercial banks. The results show that: (1) Enhanced ESG performance can mitigate liquidity risk in commercial banks by reducing the proportion of non-performing loans and improving overall financial performance. (2) By standardising and implementing sustainable business practices, ESG elements can improve commercial banks’ liquidity management levels and lessen the incidence and effects of liquidity risk. As a result, it is critical to lower banks’ liquidity risk and support the long-term growth of commercial banks from five angles: information disclosure, differentiated reform, digital transformation, education and training, and international cooperation. © 2024 by the authors.},

Despite the growing importance of sustainability reporting, there remains a gap in understanding how financial indicators influence the disclosure process, particularly in Vietnamese enterprises. This paper aims to address this gap by investigating the influence of financial indicators on the sustainability reporting practices of Vietnamese companies. Employing a mixed-methods approach, combining a quantitative analysis of financial data with a qualitative assessment of sustainability reports, the research seeks to uncover the nuanced relationship between financial performance metrics and the quality and extent of sustainability disclosures. The research was conducted to identify, evaluate, and measure financial factors affecting the quality of companies’ sustainability reports in Vietnam. The research is based on scoring the sustainable development reports of the top 100 listed joint stock companies on the HOSE—Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange. Based on the research model of Dissanayake, in the case of Vietnam, we build a scoring model for the sustainable development report based on GRI standards and add additional criteria appropriate to the situation of each listed company on the Vietnam stock exchange. Based on the research overview, our team tested hypotheses related to the short-term current ratio, total asset turnover ratio (AT), return on equity ratio (ROE), and debt-to-equity ratio (DE). The empirical results show that the AT and ROE significantly positively affect the sustainability reports; the DE hurts the sustainability reports. The findings are expected to provide valuable insights into the factors shaping sustainability reporting practices in Vietnam and contribute to the existing literature on corporate disclosure and sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.},

In addition, most studies focus on multinational firms based in the United States or Europe, while research in the context of emerging economies is scant. This paper endeavours to investigate the strength of the association between Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosure scores and the financial performance of 272 Indian firms listed on National Stock Exchange for the period 2015 to 2021 by employing panel data regression techniques. The results indicate that organisations having better ESG performance outperform their industry peers financially and are valued more by the market. Moreover, the data indicates that financial markets for lenders consider ESG disclosure when determining creditworthiness. In accordance with this, businesses can examine their operations and become more aligned with eco-friendly methods. Even though ESG disclosure appears to be associated with improved financial success, this is not the case across all industries and during COVID-19 pandemic. This study is relevant due to the growing significance of sustainability and the role of emerging nations in international commerce. It helps managers prioritize resource allocations to ESG-related activities that may affect financial performance differently across industry sectors, thus adding to the literature on the financial effects of ESG disclosures, particularly industry-specific aspects. This research represents a pioneering effort by assessing the impact of ESG disclosure on the profitability, market value, and cost of financing of Indian firms using both aggregation and disaggregation methods. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach: Thanks to a content analysis of 247 <IR> for FY20, an integrated reporting disclosure score was developed to assess the disclosure quality provided by the sampled companies. Three research questions were tested through logistic regressions. Findings: Non-financial disclosure activities struggle to provide adequate information in terms of potential future scenarios, risk assessment and forward-looking analyses. However, companies incorporated in “Anglo-Saxon” territories drafted integrated reports of higher quality. More recently, incorporated companies have made a greater effort to measure and report COVID-19 pandemic impacts on environmental, social and governance and business activities, also increasing their risk assessment and mitigation efforts. Concerning the determinants of disclosure quality, leverage, corporate governance structures, country of incorporation and belonging to “high impact” industries all lead to a higher quality of <IR> disclosure. Originality/value: Examining in detail corporate social responsibility activities and corporate governance integrity is pivotal to orienting strategy towards sustainable trajectories: to do so, corporate reporting and disclosure practices are essential tools. In this context, corporate governance systems that emphasize board diversity are proven, even in disruptive circumstances, to play a crucial role in providing corporate reports of higher quality. High disclosure quality that goes beyond mere financial results is considered to be necessary to remain competitive strategically, socially and environmentally. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Portuguese companies are increasingly responding to the demand of stakeholders for transparent information about companies’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance by issuing non-financial reports (NFRs). While the number of NFRs published annually has been increasing over the last two decades, their quality and companies’ ESG performance have been questioned, especially in times of crisis. To address these concerns, several jurisdictions have introduced mandatory NFR rules, such as the European Directive 2014/95/EU. Employing an institutional theory lens, this paper’s research objective is to evaluate whether the last decade’s crises and whether the fact that NFRs became mandatory for certain entities positively affected companies’ activities covered in the ESG reporting scope. We used panel data regression models on 45 listed companies in Portugal during the period 2008–2021. Our results show that the ESG reporting scope is not positively influenced by the transition from NFRs to a mandatory and global financial crisis (GFC). However, the COVID-19 crisis positively affected NFR quality. These results have major implications for practitioners, reflecting the importance of promoting these tools in an organization to improve non-financial performance and companies’ sustainability. © 2024 by the author.},

This negative linkage between ESG and financial performance is explained by the shareholder perspective and agency theory. The results signal the applicability of the shareholder value perspective, in the Indian context. We find that since ESG regulations are still nascent, the ESG reporting and investments of firms are not rewarded by the shareholders in the Indian capital market.

Our primary focus is to explore how the extent of media coverage moderates this relationship, thereby shedding light on the pivotal role that public scrutiny plays in shaping a company’s financial outcomes. Utilizing the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model, we rigorously control for industry and year effects, as well as firm-specific variations. Additionally, we conduct a series of supplementary analyses and robust tests to further strengthen the credibility of our findings. Our empirical analysis reveals that firms with poor ESG ratings, indicating corporate social irresponsibility, incur higher debt costs in the subsequent period. Notably, this adverse financial impact is significantly alleviated for companies that enjoy higher media coverage. This notable discovery underscores the potential of media scrutiny to reduce the financial burden imposed by inadequate ESG performance. Our results suggest that companies, especially those with limited media attention, should prioritize enhancing their ESG performance to mitigate potential financial implications. Overall, our research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the intersection between corporate social responsibility, media coverage, and financial performance. © 2024 by the authors.},

Employing resource dependence theory as our frame and drawing on qualitative data from 41 interviews with board directors of publicly traded and privately held companies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), we identify three key mechanisms underpinning the achievement of ESG goals, namely, the leveraging of particular connections, the deployment of different resources, and the harnessing of a range of diversity types. We find that the use of social resources is often related to environmental concerns and occasionally social goals, but rarely governance issues. We also find that financial motivations often drive environmental issues, while many of the social resources that added value occurred in the public sector. Importantly, the combining of both skill and social resources, rather than relying on each alone, was seen to increase the likelihood of achieving ESG goals. Our findings also point to the importance of board diversity in accomplishing the board's ESG goals, most especially functional diversity. We propose that such functional diversity, along with resources in the form of social resources and skills, needs to feature more prominently in order to improve ESG performance and outcomes. We highlight the implications of our work, especially regarding the establishment of board diversity policies beyond gender alone. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

However, the literature provides limited evidence of the relationship between CSR indicators, such as the ESG score, and the firm's profitability, which is often measured by the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). We investigate this issue by analyzing a sample of about 400 companies constituting the EuroStoxx-600 index, from 2011 to 2020, using different machine learning models. The novelty of our contribution lies in assessing whether the ESG score has a significant influence on the firms' profitability. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between ESG score and EBIT using machine learning interpretability toolboxes such as partial dependence plots and individual conditional expectation. Tools which help to measure the functional relationship between the predicted response and one or more features, while the Shapley value allows to examine the contribution of the feature to the prediction. Our findings show that the model can reach high levels of accuracy in detecting EBIT and that the ESG score is a promising predictor, compared to other traditional accounting variables. © 2023 The Authors.

Energy companies must incorporate ESG into their business plans, although it unquestionably affects their corporate financial performance (CFP). This paper aims to investigate the effect of ESG on energy companies’ profitability through return on assets by analysing the combined score and individual dimensions of ESG. Design/methodology/approach: The study examined a panel data sample of 911 firm-year observations for 85 European energy-sector companies during 1995–2020. Two distinct modelling specifications were applied to explore the impact of ESG components on the CFP of EU energy companies. The financial data and ESG scores were obtained from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database in July 2021. Findings: The empirical findings revealed that energy companies’ profitability is marginally and negatively affected by their ESG performance. Whereas independent evaluation of the ESG subcomponents indicated that environmental responsibility has a significant negative effect. In contrast, corporate social and governance responsibilities are positively but not significantly associated with the company’s CFP. Originality/value: This study fills a research gap in the ESG–CFP literature in the European energy sector, a pioneer in sustainable development. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study’s originality lies in its analysis of ESG factors’ role in profitability by considering different EU countries and energy sectors. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The authors document the performance of SPACs with and without ESG focus. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect data, from several sources, on 1,737 SPAC IPOs formed between 2003 and 2022. A SPAC's focus on ESG is classified based on declared focus in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and in post-merger annual reports. The authors examine operational and financial performance of SPACs with and without ESG focus. Findings: In the study's sample, only 50% of SPACs that announced an intention to acquire an ESG target ended up consummating a merger with an ESG private firm. ESG SPACs exhibit worse operating performance than non-ESG SPACs. Furthermore, they experience 11.6% lower 1-year post-merger excess returns than their non-ESG counterparts. Originality/value: The study provides an examination of ESG firms that came to market via mergers with SPACs, which is an alternative method to traditional initial public offerings (IPOs). The study also provides a comparison of both operational and stock performance of ESG and non-ESG SPACs. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In response to the need to deepen research on the impact of corporate ESG (environmental, social, and governance) pillars on the financial performance (FP) of banks, this study analyzes the relationship between ESG and FP in banks from emerging countries in Southeast Asia during the period 2010–2020. Using a sample of 19 banks from five countries with emerging economies, this article examines the level of information on ESG activities that banks report in each of their pillars and these pillars' impact on the FP. The research was conducted through an exploratory study using panel data (Thomson Reuters ESG data), parametric correlations, and regression models. FP is measured by return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and Tobin's Q (TQ), or the prevailing market price for exchanging assets divided by the market price of the goods newly produced. The findings show that ESG has a significant negative effect on all measures of FP (ROA, ROE, and TQ). However, analysis of the relationship of each individual ESG pillar to FP obtains different findings for each. Our study also shows differences in the level of ESG information in each country as a result of their specific economic characteristics. This study has limitations due to the limited ESG, bank, and country data that Thomson Reuters contains on banks in this region of Asia. In future research, more banks and more countries can be added to the analysis, as well as other control variables related to FP. © 2023 The Authors.

The primary objective is to assess how LLMs can replicate a systematic review on a corpus of ESG-focused papers. We compiled and hand-coded a database of 88 relevant papers published from March 2020 to May 2024. Additionally, we used a set of 238 papers from a previous systematic review of ESG literature from January 2015 to February 2020. We evaluated two current state-of-the-art LLMs, Meta AI's Llama 3 8B and OpenAI's GPT-4o, on the accuracy of their interpretations relative to human-made classifications on both sets of papers. We then compared these results to a "Custom GPT"and a fine-tuned GPT-4o Mini model using the corpus of 238 papers as training data. The fine-tuned GPT-4o Mini model outperformed the base LLMs by 28.3% on average in overall accuracy on prompt 1. At the same time, the "Custom GPT"showed a 3.0% and 15.7% improvement on average in overall accuracy on prompts 2 and 3, respectively. Our findings reveal promising results for investors and agencies to leverage LLMs to summarize complex evidence related to ESG investing, thereby enabling quicker decision-making and a more efficient market. © 2024 IEEE.},

Design/methodology/approach: A sample of the top 100 non-financial firms listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, for the years 2019–2022, has been considered. Suitable panel regression models have been used to assess the impact of non-financial disclosure on accounting and market measures of firm performance. In addition, a panel data moderating effect model is used to assess the moderating impact. Findings: The outcomes of the study partially favour the value-creation role of ESG disclosure. Specifically, the disclosure of already established ESG metrics, particularly social and governance aspects, positively impacts the market performance while environmental transparency negatively impacts the accounting performance. Of the three ESG components, only extended governance disclosure adds to market value. Results of the moderation effect reveal a significant impact of the pandemic on the ESG disclosure–financial performance relation. However, a more pronounced effect before the pandemic is observed. The results are robust to endogeneity. Originality/value: This study sheds light on the financial consequences of ESG disclosure within the context of an emerging nation. This is done by using a novel holistic ESG reporting framework to obtain more accurate results. Furthermore, the study distinguishes itself by examining the long-term moderating influence of the unexpected COVID-19 crisis on the ESG disclosure–financial performance relation. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We study this relationship considering a 17-year time span from 2005 to 2021 using a sample of all active constituent companies of the NYSE, with a final dataset of 791 firms for a total of 7,177 firm-year observations. The findings indicate that the relationship between overall ESG score and systematic risk takes an inverted U-shape. These results are solid considering ESG components at both an aggregate and disaggregate level. When companies invest little in ESG, they could be viewed as having more funds to allocate in, presumably, more rewarding projects and are more flexible and less risky, at least in the short term. However, beyond a certain threshold, more attention to sustainability facets results in lower systematic risk. These findings are also supported by checking them through different robustness tests. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

First, the regression analyses identify a clear range of turning points that airlines should consider in terms of Scopes 1 and 2 CO₂ emissions per employee and cargo ton-kilometers per employee (cargo ton-kilometers (CTK)/EMP) considering the environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Second, the deciding factors, including fundamental efforts by the airlines themselves, result from the interaction of three points, which have been encouraged and promoted in the airline industry in recent years. (1) Tighter emissions controls for air transport, (2) investors’ emphasis on environment, society, and governance (ESG), and (3) assessments and guidelines from ratings agencies and economic and environmental organizations. Third, increasing CTK/EMP to verified thresholds and taking an ESG-oriented approach can contribute to airlines’ combined achievement of growth and environmental conservation and related data will expand academic and policy-related research. © 2024, Econjournals.

Methodology: The independent variables of CFP, namely return on sales, return on asset, return on capital employed, return on equity, and Tobin’s Q and the variables of CSP ESG Score, environmental, social, and governance score individually and control variables firm age and net worth were considered. Causality and influence between CFP and CSP and vice-versa were tested through Grangular causality and panel data regression analysis, respectively, using E-views12. Secondary data were drawn from Integrated Annual Reports of the NSE-rated 27 top disclosure IT & ITeS companies selected on census sampling. Findings: It was demonstrated that there was a bidirectional correlation between ESG and social and governance and unidirectional causality between Tobin’s Q and ESG, ESG to net worth, and ESG to return on sales. IT and ITeS firms support the traditional view that sustainability costs constrain financial performance. Practical Implications: It was suggested the companies consider the elements of sustainability equally to make rational, sustainable investments to augment ESG. Establishing a standard ESG framework would serve as a guide for effective implementation.

This article presents new evidence on the impact of ESG scores on publicly traded Brazilian companies, contributing to the growing body of literature that examines the relationship between ESG practices and corporate financial performance, while addressing a gap in the analysis of the Brazilian market, the eighth-largest economy globally. By testing two main hypotheses—that ESG scores are negatively associated with the cost of capital and positively associated with return on assets—this study aimed to advance both our theoretical and empirical understanding of how sustainable practices influence financial performance within the Brazilian context. Using quantitative methods with Refinitiv data and scores from 2018 to 2022, panel regression analysis, and quantile regression, with fixed effects, this study revealed significant connections between high ESG scores and lower cost of capital, in addition to better operating performance. When the scores were evaluated separately, only the impact of environmental performance was statistically significant in the cost of capital. The environmental, social, and governance scores were statistically significant and positive for operational performance. © 2024 by the authors.},

Drawing upon the research on corporate social responsibility (CSR), shared value, and innovation, this paper aims to analyze the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG, a form of CSR) sustainability policies and corporate financial performance (CFP) by investigating the mediating role of Innovation (i.e., investment in research and development, R&D). Our sample comprises 148 European companies belonging to the Euro Stoxx index in the period 2009–2014. For high-innovation companies (HICs), we find positive relationships between some Social (S) issues and CFP and weaker linkages between Environmental (E) indicators and CFP. In contrast, Governance (G) issues (i.e., issues related to board structure and board function) negatively influence CFP. In contrast, for medium-innovation companies (MICs), these relationships are absent and low-innovation companies (LICs) show negative relationships. Adopting reporting frameworks or guidelines affects CFP only in HIC. We introduce an original interpretative model, which identifies innovation (R&D) as the main driver in corporate sustainability, particularly in light of Social issues related to the production of a good or service. In terms of managerial implications, we identify three key factors for effectively embedding ESG in organizations' policies: investment in product innovation, compliance with environmental regulations, and corporate choices on brands and channels of external communication. © 2023 The Authors.

Food companies must develop strategies to ensure food security and seek business models to provide economic, social, and environmental benefits. This paper presents the combinations of water and waste management practices (water efficiency targets, water consumption ratio, water intensity ratio, waste recycling ratio, and waste intensity ratio) that lead to an overvaluation of food companies in the stock market (Tobin's Q > 1). These combinations of practices were identified using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of a global sample of 61 listed companies from the food production sector. No necessary conditions were found for the outcome of a Tobin's Q >1. In contrast, the sufficiency analysis revealed five sufficient configurations for overvaluation. The presence of significant recycling and waste reuse performance and the absence of a strong intensity of water withdrawal and waste production are key conditions to achieve the presence of the outcome. The findings provide useful insights for managers, who can focus their business strategies on sustainable and efficient water and waste management to support high financial performance. The findings can also help investors in their decision making. © 2023 The Author(s)},

In terms of classic risk and return characteristics and modern portfolio metrics, we report mixed evidence with some sustainability indices marginally outperforming the traditional benchmarks and others staying at parity. Regionally, the evidence is heterogeneous; the Pan Arab, the Middle East (including Israel), the United States, Emerging Markets, and Europe indices reported a slightly superior performance and those belonging to Asia Pacific, Emerging Africa, and Latin America marginally underperformed compared to their conventional counterparts. The findings of this study imply that sustainable investments appear to be an encouraging investment option, although their progress has not been substantial. For an appreciable outperformance of sustainable investments, a more conducive regulatory framework should be established, including robust incentivizing policies concerning tax rebates or low capital costs. © 2024 by the authors.},

The results of an empirical analysis on data from 483 foreign subsidiaries of Korean listed firms collected through surveys from February to May 2021 are as follows. First, it was found that digital transformation capability had a positive effect on financial performance. Second, as a result of analyzing the moderating effect of the ESG level, it was found that the environmental (E) level and the social (S) level in ESG strengthened the positive relationship between digital transformation capability and financial performance. However, it was found that the level of governance (G) in ESG rather weakens the positive relationship between digital transformation capability and financial performance. The results of this study suggest that foreign subsidiaries need to actively build digital transformation capability in order to improve their financial performance. Since the results of this study suggest different moderating effects of ESG, practical implications can be suggested that foreign subsidiaries should consider the fact that different effects may occur for each ESG activity if they want to improve their financial performance through digital transformation capability. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In recent years, ESG (environmental, social, and governance) has emerged as a critical investment concept. Its goal is to create value for both shareholders and society, encouraging companies to optimize social value. However, the exploration and research into “the proportion of firms exporting and the pathways through which the environmental, social, and governance activities of carbon-intensive firms influence firms’ financial performance” remains largely unexplored. This study establishes a research framework within this context, utilizing listed Chinese manufacturing companies as the research subjects. Taking agency theory rationale and signaling theory as the theoretical framework, this study thoroughly investigates the relationship between ESG ratings, corporate export ratios, and corporate financial performance through panel regression models using fixed-time, fixed-industry, and bi-directional fixed-effects models. The results of this study show that (1) ESG ratings have a positive impact on corporate financial performance; (2) firms’ export ratios play a mediating role in the relationship between ESG ratings and corporate financial performance; and (3) carbon-intensive firms have a positive moderating effect on the relationship between ESG ratings and corporate financial performance. Based on these findings, we propose policy recommendations at the firm and government levels to increase the importance of ESG, strengthen corporate governance, and promote continuous progress in ESG. This study provides micro evidence of the interactions between ESG ratings, export ratios, carbon-intensive firms, and firm performance to enable investors to make informed decisions. © 2024 by the authors.},

Using the autoregressive distributed lag model and nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model models, the study finds a negative long-run relationship between sustainable equity investments and economic policy uncertainties in Australia, Canada, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, Italy, and Japan. Investors in these G20 countries may perceive that companies with higher ESG performance are more likely to face regulatory scrutiny, legal action, or reputational damage if they are associated with high levels of economic policy uncertainties. As a result, ESG market indices may underperform when EPU is high and vice versa. It supports prospect theory and suggests that individuals are more sensitive to potential losses than gains. On the contrary, the relationship is positive in the case of the USA, Brazil, China, and to some extent India. This might be because firms with high ESG performance could manage risks better and seize opportunities associated with EPU, which helps ESG market indices to outperform when EPU is high. It is supported by the legitimacy theory that says to maintain the legitimacy and credibility of the company, the investment must be invested in ESG initiatives, which can lead to improved long-term financial performance and market value. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Results show that companies tend to be grouped in ESG-FP performers and laggards.

Digital transformation (DT) and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) management have already become strategic requirements on the agenda of corporate management, but theories and empirical research on how to affect corporate performance through digital transformation and ESG management are lacking. This study examined the intrinsic mechanism of DT to corporate performance based on the theory of a resource-based view (RBV). In addition, the theoretical framework of ESG management as mediating variables was constructed. The ‘Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM)’ was used to verify the hypotheses derived from the literature. Empirical analysis was conducted on companies interested in DT and ESG management in Korea and China. DT positively affected ESG management and corporate performance (e.g., non-financial and financial performance). On the other hand, an examination of the relationship between ESG management and corporate performance revealed differences between the results from Korea and China. The strategic implications for corporate DT and ESG management are suggested. In particular, this study also contributes to the academic aspect by providing new explanations for applying resource-based view theory and the relationship between DT, ESG management, and corporate performance. © 2024 by the authors.},

The significant consequences of bankruptcy cases have highlighted the need for managers and regulators to develop and adopt appropriate early warning systems. Previous studies are analysed in this review according to three different aspects: definition of default and financial distress, application of statistical and intelligent techniques, and the selection of variables. The review also proposes some possible upgrades to promote future research on the topic, that is, pointing out the potential role of non-financial information and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) variables as a determinant in the default prediction of banking institutions. While the predictive accuracy of macroeconomic information has been tested in several works, there is only limited evidence of the influence of non-financial performance on a bank's probability of default. © 2024 The Author},

	abstract = {The relationship between financial performance and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics in businesses has garnered significant interest in recent years. Unlike most previous research that primarily examines the impact of ESG initiatives on a firm’s financial performance (Whelan et al., 2022), this paper explores how financial liquidity and profitability influence ESG performance. We hypothesize that profitable firms are more likely to invest in ESG initiatives. We collect financial and ESG data of S&P 500 companies from Bloomberg. Using principal component analysis (PCA) to mitigate multicollinearity, the study identifies the main principal components representing various associations of liquidity and profitability metrics. Linear regression analysis is conducted with the identified principal components as the independent variables and ESG scores as the dependent variables. The analysis reveals that profitability positively affects ESG scores, while liquidity has a negative impact. The findings suggest that our hypothesis — that profitable companies are more likely to invest in ESG initiatives — is confirmed, whereas high liquidity may indicate underinvestment in such activities. This research contributes a fresh perspective to the empirical evidence in the existing literature (Friede et al., 2015; Hang et al., 2019; Whelan et al., 2022) on the relationship between financial and ESG performance. © 2024 The Authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs panel data covering 40 JSE-listed firms included in FTSE/JSE Responsible Investment Index between 2015 and 2019. The paper employs the two-stage least squares (2SLS) instrumental variable regression technique to estimate the effect of ESG ratings and its dimensions (environmental, social and governance) on both accounting- and market-based performance indicators. Findings: The results of the two-stage least squares instrumental estimation analysis reveal that investment in ESG initiatives improves both accounting- and market-based indicators of financial performance. Of the ESG pillars, the paper finds environmental initiatives improves firms' financial bottom line and market performance, while a firm's social and governance practices are observed to have no effect on a firm's accounting and market performance measures. Practical implications: The insights from this study proffers policy implications for firms' management, investors and regulatory authorities. Originality/value: As far as the authors are concerned, this paper presents the first empirical analysis on the contribution of ESG ratings on financial performance in South Africa. © 2023, Emmerson Chininga, Abdul Latif Alhassan and Bomikazi Zeka.},

However, the effect of ESG management on corporate financial performance (CFP) is inconsistent, and not many studies have been conducted for Asia and developing countries, which are in the early stage of ESG management. In addition, although R&D investment influences ESG management, few studies have focused on the relationship between R&D investment, ESG, and CFP. We analyse the effect of ESG management on CFP using panel data combining ESG rating and financial data of Korean companies and examine moderating effect of R&D investment between ESG and CFP. We find the following results. First, ESG performance has a negative effect on CFP while there is no statistically significant effect in heavily polluting industries (HPI). Second, R&D investment has no significance on CFP, but a positive moderating effect exists between environmental (E) and social (S) performance and CFP. With environmental issues and climate change being a global concern, this study provides theoretical and managerial implications for companies to create synergies in R&D investment and ESG management. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

This paper contributes to the state of knowledge two-directionally. First, it shows the development of sustainable investing exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in European countries. Second, it traces the significant determinants of adopting sustainable investing/ESG ETFs in Europe. More specifically, we aim to determine which financial, technological, social or institutional factors have the most significant impact on the growth of levels and over-time dynamics of the sustainable investing ETFs. The empirical sample covers five European economies: France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom and the period of the analysis is 2006–2020. Adopting panel regression analysis, we investigate twenty different variables that potentially impact the development of sustainable investing ETFs across examined countries. Our results confirm the positive effects of the development of insurance companies and pension funds for the assets of the ESG ETFs. Also, factors such as stock markets development, ICT adoption, financial access and literacy, and the prevalence of tertiary-level education demonstrate a positive impact on ESG ETFs. The role of the financial performance and tax levels resulted in being neutral, thus indicating the lesser importance of the financial motives in relation to the other factors. The results were mixed in the case of the mutual funds and institutional variables. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study used multiple regression models to analyze the effectiveness of ESG practices as a mediating variable in explaining the relationship between executive incentive compensation and banks’ financial performance between 2015 and 2021. The sample consisted of 57 Islamic and conventional banks operating in the MENA region, and the data were collected from the Thomson Reuters database (Data Stream). Findings: This research paper showed the positive and significant mediating effect of the ESG practice on Banks’ financial performance. Thus, banks’ financial and stock market profitability is influenced by ESG information disclosure. This finding shows that taking ESG into account improves the relationship between executive incentive compensation and banks’ financial performance. Practical implications: The results may interest academic researchers, regulators and policymakers and would support stakeholders and decision-makers who wish to discover how executive incentive compensation affects financial performance in banks. Originality/value: This study contributes to previous literature by studying the mediating effect of ESG practices on the relationship between executive incentive compensation and banks’ financial performance. Indeed, the originality of this research paper is justified by the scarcity of studies and, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, constitutes one of the first attempts to examine this relationship via a mediating variable, i.e. ESG. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We document that firms experiencing poor ES performance in the quarter prior to the earnings call exhibit more negative management tone after controlling for quarterly financial performance metrics. Tone difference in conference calls between managers and analysts predicts negative abnormal returns in the three-day window around the call. In the 60-day post-call period, we show that firms with poor ES performance exhibit returns negatively related to the tone difference on the conference call – low tone difference leads to return continuation and high tone difference predicts reversals for firms with positive earnings surprises. These results are consistent with an increase in information asymmetry and lower transparency for firms following poor ES performance. © 2024},

	abstract = {This study investigates the crucial but understudied relationship between chief executive officer (CEO) narcissism, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance in addition to the effects of financial performance. The study examines the nexus for their long-run and short-run associations and for quantile-specific effects including causality linkages that were governed by different levels of CEO narcissism for a sample of 55 energy companies from the United States for the 2003–2022 period. Novel Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag and Panel Quantile Granger Causality methods are employed to encounter two modeling strategies. The model utilizes two newly proposed proxy variables for measuring CEO narcissism, namely, Policy Bribery and Corruption Scores (BC), and, Audit Fees (AF). Empirical findings with all CEO narcissism measures under different modeling strategies indicated positive and significant effects of CEO narcissism on ESG for all quantiles in the long run asymmetrically from the lowest levels towards higher levels of CEO narcissism with varying but positive magnitudes with an exception: at the highest quantile, the effect on ESG performances becomes reversed, indicating very high levels of CEO narcissism harming ESG performances. The short-run results also confirm these relations, confirming the effects of CEO narcissism at different levels with varying magnitudes. Quantile-specific causality tests determined causality from CEO narcissism to ESG performance in all quantiles without exception across different scenarios. Between financial performance and ESG there is a unidirectional causality from financial to ESG variables in 2nd, 4th and 5th, and, bidirectional causality at the 1st quantile. Further, CEO narcissism is the Granger-cause of financial performance in all quantiles. The new CEO narcissism variables are compared and tested statistically for robustness with traditional CEO narcissism measures of Chatterjee and Hambrick (2007, 2011). The findings of the proposed model and new CEO narcissism variables capture the dynamic changes in CEO narcissism in time and at different levels more effectively than the traditional CEO narcissism measure. The fresh finding led to a set of policy recommendations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

We find that green bond issuance promotes green innovation, with stronger effects observed in regions with weaker climate regulation, industries exhibiting better environmental performance, and firms with more concentrated ownership. Further analysis reveals that corporate green bonds facilitate the reallocation of investment capital into research and development, effectively mitigating financial constraints on green innovation. This upsurge in green innovation not only enhances financial performance but also yields specific environmental benefits, such as improved environmental investment and ESG performance. These empirical results underscore the significance of green finance in fostering sustainable corporate innovation and advancing climate governance, rather than merely engaging in greenwashing practices. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

This study uses paradox theory lens to examine conflicts in ESG integration in a business model and explore resolution strategies. We used the case study of a top ESG leader in the information and technology sector—the Ricoh Group. We identified conflicts for environmental, social, and governance factors and found they adopted a synthesis strategy for conflict resolution for all ESG issues. ESG conflicts were resolved by emphasizing that ESG practices are a global requirement with ESG department support and management power. Environmental conflicts were resolved through shifting from cost-of-capital-centric to market-competitiveness-centric. Additionally, social conflicts were resolved through feedback on market needs. We state that using the ESG framework as a promise for future finance, where its adoption of ESG practices may positively impact future financial performance and might support the integration process. We stress the importance of constant feedback with all divisions about ESG regulations and their status and progress toward achieving ESG goals. We further highlight conflict-resolution strategies adopted to support the integration of the ESG framework into the business model. © 2024 by the authors.},

We collected sample data on KOSPI-listed companies in 2021 using ESG ratings released by the Korea Corporate Governance Service. The system of ratings was segmented into three distinct categories for the purpose of analysis, namely the environment, society, and governance. An empirical investigation was conducted to determine how ESG ratings and separate ratings (E, S, and G ratings) affect financial performance. We also examined the moderating impact of the debt ratio on the association between ESG ratings and financial performance to enhance the explanatory strength of this relationship. The results indicated that ESG ratings and E and S ratings are positively related to financial performance, and the debt ratio has a negative moderating effect on the link between ESG ratings related to environmental aspects and financial performance. The findings indicate that firms need ESG management to improve financial performance. ESG ratings can be utilized to show the effects of environment-focused management, sustainability, and CSR initiatives on financial performance. Additionally, the moderation effect of the debt ratio in this study clearly demonstrates the connection between ESG rating and financial performance. Our analysis also demonstrates that organizations with high debt ratios and a lack of resources to pursue ESG are unable to devote a significant amount of time and resources to ESG management. © 2024 Conscientia Beam.

We examine an international sample of 96 banks located in 33 countries using quarterly data covering the 2017-Q4 - 2022-Q3 period. Our findings show the existence of a positive ESG - asset quality relationship, which can be even reversed for particularly high levels of profitability. Moreover, we report significant differences between banks located in the European Union (EU) and in non-EU countries. We contribute to the literature by analysing the ESG - asset quality relationship, which has been hitherto largely overlooked, and we are the first quantifying how the marginal effect of ESG on asset quality varies depending on the level of profitability. Our findings have important policy and managerial implications in that banks should not only implement (and be pushed to implement) better ESG strategies, but also stabilise their financial performance, avoiding unsustainable short-term profits that could reverse the beneficial effects of ESG on asset quality. © 2024 The Authors},

Our methodology entails two steps and is based on diversification-consistent DEA models.

In the second step, a new DEA model is proposed in order to find the ESG-efficient portfolios among the ones already identified in the first step and to rank them with respect to their ESG performance. This model is parameterised by a weighting system that allows us to assign different importance to the various ESG outputs. Additionally, the proposal allows an evaluation of both ESG and financial efficiency related to the financial energy market over two periods (the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods), considering renewable energy and non-renewable energy firms both jointly and separately. The results support the better financial performance of the renewable energy stock market compared with that of the non-renewable energy market. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Analyzing data from Taiwan’s 20 industries from 2012 to 2022, it finds that while ESG engagement positively influences financial performance, it also underscores the vital connection between corporate practices and sustainable development. This analysis explores the relationship between carbon emissions, operating expenses, and financial performance in the overall sample and a threshold sample based on a threshold variable. In the overall sample, carbon emissions significantly increase operating expenses, accompanied by other influential variables. Introducing a threshold value of firm size alters the dynamics, showing a positive and more pronounced impact in the threshold sample. The examination of financial performance metrics reveals significant positive associations with carbon emissions, particularly when the threshold is not met or exceeded. Intriguingly, subgroup analysis indicates a negative association between carbon emissions and financial performance within the larger-size subgroup, in stark contrast to a more pronounced positive relationship observed in the smaller-size subgroup. Furthermore, the developed ANN model exhibits robust learning capabilities, underscoring its efficacy in capturing complex patterns within the data. It suggests its potential as a reliable tool for accurately predicting carbon emissions across diverse scenarios, facilitating informed decision-making and policy formulation to mitigate environmental impact. © 2024 by the authors.},

While ESG ratings are widely used to assess a company's non-financial performance, the impact of these factors on financial stability and systemic risk is still under debate. By extending the Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) method with a double regularization on both the underlying vector autoregressive (VAR) parameters and the covariance matrix of the VAR residuals, we are able to address the curse of dimensionality within each estimation. This allows us to examine how vulnerable a company is and how much systemic impact a company has given its specific ESG. Looking at a larger sample of European stocks over the period 2007–2022, we empirically show that both the best and worst ESG performers have the largest impact on the financial system in normal times. However, during a crisis, companies with the best ESG ratings generate significant spillovers throughout the system. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating ESG factors into systemic risk assessments and monitoring companies’ ESG performance to ensure financial stability. Policymakers can benefit from this research by supporting investment in high ESG companies to mitigate relevant spillovers during stressed market conditions, when such companies are more interconnected. © 2024 The Author(s)},

Our results confirm the influence of female directors on the four scores (overall, governance, social, and environmental) and the impact of the national institutional context. In countries with more freedom, such as liberal market economies, female directors are complementary to the VoCs. The stakeholder and citizenship framework of mixed market economies appears to be the most substitutive to the influence of board gender diversity on ESG scores.

Other data were obtained through the websites of the relevant businesses/sectors. Case overview/synopsis: In March 2022, Pushp Kumar Joshi, chairman and managing director of HPCL, contemplates the oil giant’s sustainability strategy amid challenges. Despite a 38% revenue increase in financial year 2021–2022, profits dropped because of reduced refinery capacity. HPCL, a major player in India’s oil and gas industry, recognized the need to align with climate goals and changing consumer expectations. Joshi emphasized stakeholder engagement, carbon mitigation, technology adoption and transparent environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting. A materiality assessment highlighted key issues like gender diversity, air quality and the low-carbon transition. Joshi grapples with balancing profitability and sustainability amid stakeholder pressure and market fluctuations, seeking advice from the sustainability team for the future. Complexity academic level: This can potentially be a case study for a business management course, particularly focusing on sustainability, corporate social responsibility and strategic decision-making. It could be used at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in courses related to business administration, sustainability management, corporate strategy, environmental management or stakeholder engagement.

The main objective of our study was to examine whether the financial data of large companies can be correlated with the data in their non-financial reports and provide information on the level of corporate governance and corporate responsibility and to examine the correlation between them. For this purpose, we conducted research by examining the 100 largest companies in Greece, over a period of 3 years, collecting both financial and non-financial data from their official reports. Using appropriate quantitative tools such as similarity, classification and econometric methods (stepwise method and panel least-squares method), the correlations between the data for CSR, CG and non-financial actions and key financial performance ratios are evaluated. Our research has revealed a strong link between financial performance and ESG actions of large companies and, in particular, we demonstrated the positive correlation of CSR performance with their total assets and whether they are listed on the stock exchange, and of CG with CSR and EBITDA. This study adds to the existing academic discourse on the relationship between financial and non-financial information of corporations in the areas of Corporate Responsibility and Governance and provides a valuable way to assess the decisions of businesses. © 2024 by the authors.},

We study the impact of ESG scores on both the financial performance and risk-propensity of European banks using panel data from 2005 to 2022. Given the role of Swiss banks as frontrunners regarding the implementation of CSR-related regulations in the financial industry, we also shed light on the Swiss case. Controlling for bank and time fixed effects we confirm a U-shaped relationship between ESG and financial performance, and an inverted U-shaped relationship between ESG and risk for Swiss banks. Remarkably, we find no relationship between CSR initiatives and financial performance for European banks and find a direct negative effect of CSR on risk density. These results indicate the need to consider institutional differences in the CSR debate. Moreover, we show that promoting ESG initiatives in the financial industry might lead to adverse effects (i.e. lower financial performance and higher risk) if banks do not commit sufficiently to those CSR investments. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {This study empirically examines factors that can influence the sustainable corporate performance of Korean business-to-business (B2B) companies with the help of unique survey data. Factors such as technological capability, the chief executive officer (CEO)’s risk-taking propensity, B2B seller skill, and key account management (KAM) are analyzed to clarify their impact on sustainable financial and non-financial performance. In particular, given that environment, society, and governance (ESG) reporting has recently been widely recognized as an important evaluation factor for companies, we look at the mediating effects of ESG management on sustainable business performance. The results show that the CEO’s risk-taking propensity and B2B seller skill significantly impact the company’s sustainable financial performance, while technological capability and the CEO’s risk-taking propensity significantly impact sustainable non-financial performance. The fact that a CEO’s risk-taking propensity affects both sustainable financial and non-financial performance indicates the importance of entrepreneurial competency in the sustainability of the company. Furthermore, the findings reveal that ESG management plays a crucial role in sustainable corporate performance. The mediating role of ESG management allows technological capability, B2B seller skill, and KAM to influence sustainable financial performance significantly. Likewise, all of the explanatory factors contribute to the company’s sustainable non-financial performance through ESG management. The findings are important for both practitioners and scholars because they emphasize the need to establish an optimal ESG management strategy for corporate survival and sustainability. Furthermore, this study underscores that ESG management should be implemented by all organizational members, from CEOs to employees. Future research will include more comprehensive samples and analyze various strategic factors not covered in this study to derive effective ways by which companies can increase their performance and sustainability. We will also explore the factors that contribute to good ESG management practices. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The literature are abound with studies on the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors on a company's value, or more broadly, on its financial performance. However, most analyses concern developed markets, mainly because the largest rating agencies operate in these markets, as well as because these are markets where ESG awareness and regulations have developed much faster. In developing markets, the number of studies in this area is disproportionately smaller. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to examine the relationship between the environmental, social, and governance ratings (ESGR) of Polish listed companies included in the WIG-ESG index and their value. This study covered 36 companies listed in WIG-ESG in the period of 2019-2023. We used market data, financial data from examined companies and ESG data provided by Refinitive. The empirical results were negative but a non-statistically significant influence of ESGR and a company's value. Further analysis indicated that none of the sub-ratings (environmental rating (ER), social rating (SR) and governance rating (GR)) had significant impact on value. The Polish market does not seem to recognize the potential of ESG factors in building the long-term value of companies and believes that the costs of ESG factors outweigh the benefits. Investors seem to disregard or underestimate ESG criteria when valuing companies, which may seem irrational when looking at the long-term effects of ESG factors. This article contributes to the existing literature by being part of the research on ESG factors and company value. The article expands the field of analysing the relationship between ESGRs and corporate value by examining this relationship not only using the overall ESGR, but also its individual sub-ratings. We also attempt to answer the question of where the channels of transmission of ESGRs on the value of the company are located, and which areas affect ratings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of this type for the Polish market.  © 2024 Magdalena Mikołajek-Gocejna, published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Historically, investments in innovation are perceived as one of the paramount decisions businesses opt to thrive and the impact of such investments on businesses' market performance is well documented in the literature. However, the environmental aspects of making such investments are yet to be addressed by the firms, which in turn, present considerable damage to the environment. Coupling with the natural resource-based view (NRBV) and the stakeholder theory of the firm, this research builds on an earlier work of Khalil and Nimmanunta (2021) in an attempt to examine the link between innovation and firms' environmental and financial value. The authors extend their analysis and document a more consistent approach to measuring environmental innovation which allows the authors to investigate the firms from three additional economies with respect to firms' investments in both traditional and environmental innovations. Design/methodology/approach: The underlying models are tested using the time fixed-effects panel regression by utilizing information from publicly traded companies of ten Asian economies, including Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Malaysia, Singapore, India, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia. The reported sample covers annual firm-level ESG data obtained from Thomson Reuters' Datastream and Refinitiv Eikon during the 2015–2019 period. Findings: This research offers support to the conventional wisdom that innovation is advantageous to the firms' market value. The authors further decompose innovation into traditional innovation and environmental innovation. The findings of this research suggest that traditional innovation is favorable only for the firms' market valuation and traditional innovation is strongly ineffectual for the environment – traditional innovation produces sizeable environmental distress by contributing substantially to carbon emissions. In contrast, the resultant effects of investments in environmental innovation are evident to be instrumental for both firms' financial performance and the environment. Research limitations/implications: This research has primarily focused on only two components of a company's environmental performance: reduction in carbon emissions (CO2) and corporate social responsibility (CSR). Given the complexity of firms' environmental strategies and the multidimensionality of the variable, which encompasses a wide range of corporate behavior in terms of relationships with communities, suppliers, consumers, and broader environmental responsibilities broadening the scope of the study by including other important aspects of environmental sustainability is, therefore, critical. Practical implications: The findings of this research signify environmental innovation as one of the vital investment approaches as firms can exploit benefits related to the market from firms' sustainable practices, developing eco-friendly processes by introducing steady yet systematic chains of green products and services. Such products and services may have a feature of enhanced functionality with a better layout in terms of improved product life with better recycling options, and lower consumption and exploitation of energy and natural resources. These sustainable practices would be advantageous for the firms regarding the possibility of setting prices above the standard level through establishing green brands and gaining market share of environmentally anxious consumers. For those companies that are striving to take the leading role in the green industry and longing to seek superior returns on the companies' environmental investments, these benefits, in particular, are exceptionally critical to them. Originality/value: The linkage between firms' financial and environmental performance in the context of simultaneous inclusion of both green and traditional innovations remains unclear and is yet to be investigated by researchers. Thus, this research shed light on the role of environmental innovation and traditional innovation on firms' environmental performance and financial performance. The authors utilize a novel dataset with a clear indication of measuring different elements of innovation that allows us to develop a more robust approach to corporates' environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance metrics having the slightest biases related to transparency and firm size. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We utilize a robust two-way fixed-effects approach to examine 2905 Chinese listed enterprises spanning 2010 to 2022. Our primary objective is to unravel the direct effects of climate change exposure (CCE) on corporate financial performance (CFP) and corporate energy performance (CEP), and to explore how CEOs' green experience moderates these effects. The findings delineate significant adverse effects on CFP and CEP stemming from CCE. Notably, augmenting CEOs’ green experience can help to mitigate these effects. We also emphasize the pivotal roles of green technology innovation (GTI) and the augmentation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance as primary conduits through which CCE influences CFP and CEP. Our study illuminates nuanced variations in these influences that are based on climate risk type, geographical regions, firm scale, and industry. These insights offer fresh theoretical perspectives and robust evidence that are crucial for tackling climate-related challenges, especially in the context of emerging economies such as China. They also provide important implications for government actions, suggesting ways to refine environmental policy at the firm level. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the factors that influence the relationship between sustainability and financial performance (FP) of the European listed companies. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzed data from 795 companies in 21 European countries by applying linear mixed-effects multilevel regressions, a two steps system generalized method of moments and quantile regression models to uncover the links between sustainability and FP. Findings: The past four decades have witnessed abundant research to determine the relationship between corporate sustainability and FP. Thus, conducting further research in 2023 could be seen as “reinventing the wheel.” Yet, earlier research considered firms as isolated entities with sustainability and FP being dependent only on that firm’s actions. By contrast, with the help of network governance theory, this study shows that a firm’s sustainability and FP depend on an interplay among interorganizational actors, such as institutional qualities, macroeconomic factors and an embrace of sustainability. Here, large firms play an essential role. Three significant findings are drawn. First, sustainability performance has a significant impact on FP in the European context. Second, the institutional quality (IQ) of the rule of law and control of corruption plays a crucial role in enhancing sustainability and FP, and finally the interaction of IQ and economic growth helps to increase companies’ market value (Tobin’s Q). The consistent and empirically robust findings offer key lessons to policymakers and practitioners on the interplay among multiple actors in corporate sustainability and FP. Practical implications: A synergetic multifaced relationship between governmental institutions and corporations is inevitable for ensuring sustainable development. The degree of intimacy in the relationship, of course, will be determined by the macroeconomic environment. Originality/value: In this research, this study theoretically and empirically identified that corporate sustainability and FP are not solely dependent on corporate operation. Rather, it is transformed, modified and shaped through an interaction of multiple actors’ trajectories in the macro business environment. © 2023, ABM Fazle Rahi, Jeaneth Johansson and Catherine Lions.},

	abstract = {Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) was usually referred to as a concept where companies initiate voluntary action towards social and environmental concerns in the context of business operations related to the stakeholders of the company prior to the CSR Act 2013 in India. Post-2013, the voluntary initiative was replaced by regulatory guidelines to address social and environmental concerns. The CSR applicability–investment gap was used as a base concept in this study with instrumental theory; the study offers a strategic perspective of CSR and how organizations emphasized maximizing stakeholders’ value. In order to further investigate the effect of CSR on corporate financial performance (CFP) through the measure of shareholders’ value, i.e., the return on equity (ROE), the study used the sample from the National Stock Exchange (NSE)-Nifty-100 indexed companies of Emerging Economy—India for a span of fourteen years (2009–2023). The vast majority of research in this domain is conducted in developed countries; the research gap is filled by this study by considering India and drawing samples from multiple industries. The empirical model was developed by using panel data regression, where the dependent variable was ROE, and the independent variables were earning per share (EPS), log total income (LTI), CSR applicability/profit after tax (CRSAPPPAT), and CSR investment/profit after tax (CSRIPAT). The findings also highlighted the CSR applicability and investment of the firms during pre- and post-Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) periods. The same was also analyzed for the firms committed to CSR and not committed to CSR. The results indicated that there is no significant impact of the CSR/ESG initiatives (applicability and investment) on the ROE of the firms. The performance could be better if the companies minimize the CSR/ESG promise–performance gap through effective communication with stakeholders. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between ESG and financial performance and explores the influence of firms’ information environment on this relationship. To do this, we construct an information environment index from several proxy measures, evaluate ESG performance using Refinitiv’s ESG scores, and evaluate financial performance using return on assets and Tobin’s Q. We find that the information environment index has a positive relationship with both return on assets and Tobin’s Q ratio. On the contrary, ESG has a negative association with return on assets but a statistically insignificant relationship with Tobin’s Q. The negative relationship of ESG with return on assets is convex and weaker in companies with better information environments. We also show that in firms with high asset turnover ratios, ESG does not harm profitability. Separately examining the ESG components reveals that each similarly relates to profitability but that governance has a less negative impact. Our study reveals non-linearities in the relationship between ESG and financial performance that can help companies set better targets and implement better practices about ESG. The moderating effect of the information environment reveals the importance of information dissemination in preventing ESG practices from creating unfavorable consequences. This study may shed light on a more effective ESG policy by showing ways to reduce the adverse financial effects of ESG practices. © 2024 by the authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative and descriptive research was carried out based on secondary data from the Refinitiv Eikon® database, using the panel data regression technique, considering the constructs: innovation, ESG performance and economic and financial performance. Findings: The results showed that companies that tend to invest more financial resources in R&D are more likely to have higher ESG performance. In addition, companies that have higher ESG performance tend to have higher economic and financial performance. Practical implications: Managers may consider investing more resources in R&D to achieve superior ESG performance. They should be aware that ESG is a strategic tool for creating financial and nonfinancial value for the organization. More than the traditional preparation of a financial report, stakeholders demand another type of information: ESG information. Originality/value: The results confirm the basis of Stakeholder Theory, showing that the companies that meet the needs of all stakeholders tend to have greater economic and financial performance. ESG practices can include keeping employees motivated to work, improved corporate image in the eyes of customers, more satisfied suppliers and community and environment aligned with management. Therefore, these ESG initiatives are instrumental in protecting organizational objectives as well as increasing shareholder value. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a sample of 431 firms selected as the 100 America’s Most Just Companies between 2016 and 2020 by JUST Capital. This study performs both an event study to determine whether the rankings are useful to investors and cross-sectional regression analyses on the characteristics of selected firms compared to their peers. Findings: This study finds that investors react positively to selected firms around the time of the release of the JUST 100 rankings, suggesting that the rankings are decision-useful. This study also finds that selected firms exhibit higher accounting quality and financial performance than their peers. Research limitations/implications: Rankings may not be free from bias because of JUST Capital’s ownership of an exchange-traded fund. Social implications: The findings validate the rankings as well as the methodology used by JUST Capital, as they show market participants value firms that engage in socially responsible actions through their commitment to positively impact five key stakeholder groups: employees, customers, communities, environment and shareholders. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that shows the importance of the JUST 100 rankings for investment decisions.

The first is to conduct a comprehensive examination of the various board attributes to corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting in the Chinese technology industry. The second is to investigate the impact of ownership and board attributes on CSR. The third is to examine the moderating effect of media reporting on the relationship between CSR and company financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: All A-share listed Chinese companies during the years 2011–2019 with 1,573 firm-year observations have been investigated for this study. The data are analysed by CSR metrics in the form of environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores using an ordinary least squares regression analysis and fixed effect regression models. Findings: The results of this longitudinal study reveal that; no matter whether the companies are state-own or non-state-own, there is a significant positive effect of board independence, monetary incentives, director’s age and board size on the CSR disclosure of the Chinese technology industry. Also, the results support the importance of CSR performance in promoting the corporate financial performance (CFP) of the technology sector. Specifically, media reporting has a positive impact on the CSR reporting of both state-own and non-state-own technological companies in China. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study based on the ESG metrics for analysing the CSR and firm performance relationship conducted in the unique setting of the state-own and non-state-own technological companies in China. The study is an attempt to fill the gap in the extant literature, which has a scarce number of studies focused on the influence of media reporting on the relationship between CSR performance and CFP. This paper not only updates the existing understanding of CSR performance by board attributes and company ownership but also explains the significance of media reporting in enhancing the CSR performance of the Chinese technology industry. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {What determines the effectiveness of corporate boards? Corporate legal scholars usually approach this question by focusing on directors' incentives, such as counting how many directors are independent or whether the roles of the CEO and Chair are separated. Yet on the ground, the focus has been shifting to directors' skill sets and experience. Investors, regulators, and courts are now pressuring companies to appoint directors with specific types of expertise. In response, more and more companies are adding what we term "specialist directors": a DEI director, a climate director, a cyber director, and so on. These changes in board composition could reshape corporate governance and impact broader societal issues such as data privacy and environmental degradation. This Article examines the ongoing • shift in board expertise and makes the following three contributions. First, the Article presents evidence on the scope and magnitude of the changes in board expertise. We hand-collect and hand-code data from the proxy statements ofS&P 500 (large cap) and S&P 600 (small cap) companies over the 2016-2022 period. We find that over the past few years companies have not only significantly increased their emphasis on expertise disclosure, but also added hundreds of directors with narrower, ESG-related expertise. : Second, the Article analyzes how these shifts in board expertise could affect corporate behavior, and whether they are likely to prove overall desirable from a societal perspective. It is intuitive to think of board expertise as an unalloyed good. But we merge insights from interviews with nomination committee members with insights from the literature on group decision-making, to highlight five realistic concerns arising from the current trend. The injection of new, narrow types of expertise could distort board dynamics, create "authority bias," overly increase the size of boards, hinder efforts to promote board diversity, and result in "board washing" whereby human capital disclosure camouflages the company's actual behavior. Finally, the Article generates concrete policy implications. For regulators, the main lessons concern rethinking the desirability of legal intervention and ensuring more credible and comparable expertise disclosure. For courts, the main lessons revolve around how to assess board behavior in oversight-duty litigation and what to consider when approving derivative settlements. © 2024 Yale Journal on Regulation.

	abstract = {The tension between shareholder primacy and stakeholder capitalism embodies a fundamental debate about the purpose of a corporation. These two perspectives offer contrasting views on whether a company should primarily serve the interests of its shareholders or consider the broader spectrum of stakeholders in its decision-making process, taking into account environmental, social and governance factors alongside financial performance. The Dodd-Berle debate from the 1930s and Milton Friedman’s teachings in the 1970s regarding the purpose of a corporation and the tension between shareholder primacy and stakeholderism have been reinvigorated. On the one hand, ESG considerations have become increasingly important in risk mitigation and shareholder value protection, since externalities are becoming more extreme, requiring urgent coordinated action that cannot be handled by government regulation alone. If not addressed, these issues could create systemic risks impacting all businesses at once. Stakeholder capitalism nonetheless receives criticism for its flaws in capital allocation, unclear measurement and disclosure, lack of accountability, negative impact on financial performance, and distraction from the need for government regulation. Certain extreme situations of stakeholder-centric decisions that cannot be reconciled with value creation for shareholders could potentially constitute a breach of management’s duty of loyalty if they involve self-dealing or conflict of interest situations, resulting in the unavailability of the business judgment rule protection. © 2024 by Thiago Spercel.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study investigates the empirical association between environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) performance and top executive compensation in the US financial services industry. Considering that financial firms can inflict systemic shocks across the economy, it has been argued that they must conduct ethical and sustainable business in accordance with ESG principles. This study examines whether ESG efforts are beneficial to managers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use CEO compensation and ESG performance ratings data for all US financial firms (SIC 6000–6799) from 2015 to 2019. Employing fixed effects regressions, the authors test whether lagged ESG performance is related to CEO compensation, after controlling for other firm characteristics such as size, financial performance, leverage and CEO stock ownership. Findings: The authors find that lagged ESG ratings are strongly associated with all forms of compensation. An increase of one standard deviation in the composite ESG rating is associated with a 14%–16% increase in the total pay. Among the three ESG pillars, only S (social) and G (governance) exhibit persistent and significant associations with both short- and long-term executive pay. The authors also document the significant moderating effects of ESG on the relationships among firm performance, size, leverage, ownership and executive pay, identifying how ESG is associated with compensation. Originality/value: The authors conclude that managers receive ESG incentives implicitly and explicitly. The novel finding of direct and indirect associations between ESG and top executive compensation contributes to the growing ESG literature on the financial sector and ongoing debate about the explicit inclusion of ESG targets in compensation design. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to analyze the influence of Environmental, Social, and Governance disclosures on the corporate financial performance of companies in the ASEAN-5 countries. This study uses a quantitative approach with secondary data of non-financial companies indexed in the top companies list of each respective country, acquired from Bloomberg and annual reports with a period ranging from 2015 to 2022. This research also tests two models differentiated by corporate financial performance as the dependent variables used, proxied by Return on Asset and Return on Equity, with each model consisting of 423 and 546 observables processed using SPSS 29 as the statistical software. Results show that Social Disclosure Score has a significantly positive influence on the corporate financial performance used in both models. Meanwhile, Environmental Disclosure Score and Governance Disclosure Score do not show significant influences on corporate financial performance in both models. Companies could prioritize their social disclosures by increasing transparency about corporate social responsibility activities, such as employee welfare programs and community development projects, that can build their reputation and potentially improve financial performance through a commitment to social impact. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

However, the findings are mixed regarding the holistic impact of ESG in the context of Chinese companies. Using the ESG ratings data of SynTao Green Finance from 2010 to 2020, we investigate how a company’s aggregate ESG score affects its financial performance, using a staggered difference-in-differences model. We find that (1) the overall ESG ratings of Chinese companies positively impact their financial performance; (2) the positive effects are achieved through alleviating agency problems, increasing R&D investment, and improving total factor productivity; (3) the effect is stronger in heavily polluting industries and state-owned enterprises; and (4) the larger a company, the more significant the influence of its ESG ratings on its financial performance. Our findings imply that companies should actively promote ESG practices through green production, active participation in social welfare-enhancing activities, and improved corporate governance systems. Moreover, the Chinese government should strongly support ESG practices, improve the ESG information disclosure system, and establish an incentive mechanism for companies’ ESG practices. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore the relationship between board composition and a firm’s commitment to combatting climate change. Specifically, this study investigates how various characteristics of the board, namely its size and presence of independent directors, and of the directors themselves, including gender diversity, age, educational background and national homogeneity, affect the corporate-level climate change orientation. From a theoretical standpoint, the authors take a cross-fertilizing perspective, bridging upper echelons theory with agency, resource dependence and critical mass theories. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses ordered probit regression models on a hand-collected multi-country and multi-industry sample of 35 listed firms included in the Global Climate Change Liquid Equity Index (GALPLACC) provided by ECPI. This index is particularly relevant as it focuses on firms that have demonstrated a commitment to climate change, providing a robust dataset for the analysis. Findings: The findings underscore the importance of disentangling various characteristics of corporate boards and directors. Specifically, the orientation toward climate change is negatively influenced by both board size and having a higher number of independent directors, while it is positively affected by reaching a critical mass of women on the board. Conversely, factors such as average age, educational background and the level of national homogeneity do not show significant effects. Originality/value: This paper has an exploratory nature and contributes to the ongoing debate on the crucial, yet controversial role played by board-level and directors’ sociodemographic characteristics in shaping a firm’s environmental stance. Moreover, this study offers potential recommendations for policymakers regarding board composition to enhance firms’ climate change orientation. © 2024, Andrea Lippi and Ilaria Galavotti.},

The assessment of banks is based on their environmental impact, social responsibility and governance practices.

The timeframe of the research is 10 years and includes 61 European banks, thus providing an extensive review of existing literature and empirical analysis to reveal the complex link between environmental policies, ESG performance and financial performance in the banking sector. Findings: Better ESG performance is associated with lower ROE but also lower systematic risk for European banks. An improved environmental and social performance leads to higher ROE and lower beta coefficients. However, higher governance scores depress ROE. Originality/value: The paper aims to contribute to the existing literature by showcasing a complex link between ESG practices and financial performance, focusing extensively on the banking sector.

	abstract = {The purpose of this research paper is to explore the connection between Corporate Governance, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), Audit Committee (AC) and Financial Performance in European Investment Holding Companies. This paper aims to understand whether there is a correlation between these elements. The study answers the following research question: "What is the impact of corporate governance indicators, ESG and financial performance on investments in public holding companies in Europe?" Our findings reveal significant correlations between corporate governance structures and financial performance metrics, as well as the influence of ESG ratings on financial performance and corporate governance. Additionally, we identify the effects of audit committee characteristics on financial performance and ESG outcomes. The reported data is collected from a sample of companies included in the Refinitiv Eikon Database and analysed using a panel data analysis at both regional and industry level. The sample is composed of 228 European Companies, covering a period of 4 years, from 2019-2022. I chose this because it includes the impact of the pandemic and the post-pandemic recovery period, providing insight into the adaptability and resilience of companies in the face of major economic challenges. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamics between corporate governance, ESG practices and financial performance, providing valuable insights for investors, managers and regulators aiming to navigate sustainable investment strategies in the European market. This sample is considered large enough to provide meaningful data and draw relevant conclusions. Companies from various European countries were included to reflect the diversity of the market and to analyse variations in governance and ESG practices in different national contexts. The focus on public holding companies provides a specific perspective on how these entities manage corporate governance and ESG, given their importance in the European economy. The selection of the sample was based on the availability of financial and corporate governance data to ensure the reliability and validity of the analysis. This data will be used to investigate how governance and ESG practices influence companies' financial performance, thus providing important insights for understanding the relationship between these aspects within the European market. © 2024 Proceedings of the European Conference on Management, Leadership and Governance.

The potential enhancement of shareholder value through ESG disclosure is still inconsistent. Empirical studies on the association between ESG disclosure and financial performance are mixed and limited in emerging economies. This study aims to examine whether ESG disclosure impacts the financial performance of 24 Vietnamese commercial banks in terms of return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and net interest margin (NIM). The study uses the feasible generalized least squares estimation method based on panel data from 2018 to 2022. The study employs content analysis on 12 themes related to environmental, social, and governance pillars to score policy disclosure based on the Fair Finance Guide Methodology. The results highlight the positive effects of ESG policy disclosure, individual environment disclosure (E), and individual governance disclosure (G) on bank financial performance. Notably, ESG, E, and G have the largest influence on ROE, with coefficients of 0.051, 0.036, and 0.027, respectively, at a 5% significance level. However, the study does not provide evidence of a statistically significant association between social disclosure and financial performance. These results provide empirical evidence for regulators and bank managers to shape ESG policies and practices aligning with international standards. © Bui Thi Thu Loan, Tran Thi Lan Anh, Trang Hoang, 2024.},

It seeks to provide clarity on how fulfilling ESG responsibilities influences financial performance, while examining differential effects across firm types. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzes the relationship between ESG performance and financial metrics using data from Chinese listed companies (2013–2022) and DuPont’s analytical framework. Findings: First, while ESG practices enhance financial stability and market appeal, they also incur additional operating costs. Second, companies tend to increase their investments in innovation and capital expenditure as a result of better ESG performance. While capital expenditure boosts financial performance significantly, innovation investment, though promising, yields uncertain outcomes and has less influence compared to capital expenditure. Furthermore, the financial performance of nonstate-owned and nonpolluting firms is more susceptible to fluctuations in ESG performance. Research limitations/implications: The findings are context-specific and may not universally apply to all industries and regions. Further research is needed to validate the study’s propositions in diverse economic environments. Practical implications: Policymakers should consider incentivizing ESG compliance to bolster market competitiveness. Enterprises are advised to optimize internal processes to balance ESG practices with operational efficiency and innovation for sustainable growth. Originality/value: This paper introduces an innovative use of DuPont analysis in economics to explore how ESG affects financial and operational performance, showing it can boost corporate results and prompt ESG responsibility. It also distinguishes innovation outcomes with “Innovation Investment” and “Capital Expenditure,” offering enhanced investment guidance. © 2024, Xiaoya Shan, Yang Song and Peilei Song.},

The study sample included 188 firms from 2015 to 2023. Panel regression was used to account for the firm- and time-specific unobservable variables, while the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation was used to account for endogeneity concerns. The results reveal a significant negative relationship between ESG combined score and Tobin's Q, suggesting that higher ESG ratings are associated with lower firm valuation. Additionally, the impact of the Governance score on Tobin's Q is negative and statistically significant at the 1% level. The results validate the trade-off theory, indicating that investors may view investments in ESG initiatives less favorably at least in the short run, suggesting that listed companies with strong stakeholder-oriented practices are not rewarded with a premium price. The findings underscore the importance of ESG initiatives for management and decision makers to enhance investor awareness about the role of ESG initiatives in contributing to long-term shareholder value through sustainable growth, improved stakeholder relationships, and effective risk management.  © 2024 AESS Publications.

	abstract = {Sustainability practices have a positive effect on the financial performance of SMEs. We extract ESG-related information for a sample of Spanish SMEs over the period 2012–2022 using tools provided by the Internet Archive to estimate a staggered difference-in-differences model of how the release of new ESG-related information impacts the financial performance of SMEs. ESG-related information can be delivered as an endogenous signal or as an exogenous certification. We show that both types of ESG-related information have a positive effect on SMEs’ financial performance and that both are informational substitutes. We also show that institutional change in the form of the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change moderated the sustainability–performance relation. Specifically, post-Paris, the value-creating impact of exogenous ESG certification increased, while endogenous ESG signals without external certification became ineffective or detrimental. Finally, in line with CSR-as-insurance theory, we show that SMEs with higher performance variability benefit more from sustainability orientation. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Method/Design/Approach: This research was conducted on companies that follow the Corporate Image Index (CII) 2015-2019 and are listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. A company's CII score indicates its reputation level. A total of 180 observations met the research sample criteria. Results and Conclusion: The results indicate that CSR has no direct relationship with good financial performance. However, reputation has a positive effect on financial performance. It has been proven that the more reputable a company is, the stronger its appeal to improve financial performance. Interestingly, when CSR is moderated by reputation, it shows a positive relationship with financial performance. Research Implications: These results contribute to fixing previous findings by confirming the role of a firm's reputation in the association between CSR and firm performance.

The study aims to extend prior literature by covering the impacts of the institutional context on board diversity and ESG outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: Using a thematic analysis of interviews with 42 UAE board members, this research uncovers the effects of institutional context on ESG outcomes. The study focuses on the impact of culture, the influence of regulatory bodies and the relationship between critical board diversity traits and ESG. Findings: Three major themes emerged from the data: the impact of institutional context and culture, the impact of regulatory bodies and critical board diversity traits’ relationship with ESG. The findings indicate that the institution’s cultural and regulatory context impacts board diversity and ESG. The findings also demonstrate that the board’s functional diversity (educational and occupational diversity) and age diversity impact ESG outcomes. Originality/value: This research contributes to resource dependence theory by indicating the specific resources diverse directors bring to a corporate board. The study also highlights how institutional context dictates the types of resources directors seek for effective ESG implementation, providing a novel insight into board diversity’s role in ESG performance. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The relevance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is increasing as an important factor in managers’ decision-making process. Future sustainable and continuing corporate financial performance (CFP) can only be achieved by considering stakeholders’ expectations and improving corporate social performance (CSP). Being a driver of a company’s prospective economic performance, CSR has become an element of risk analysis, which explains its growing relevance for authorities, banks, and investors. Therefore, this study examines the relationship between CSP and firm risk, hypothesising a risk-mitigating effect of CSP. Using corporates’ leverage and beta as indicators for firm-idiosyncratic and systematic risk, 250 firm-year observations between 2015 and 2019 of the German DAX 30 and MDAX are analysed within multiple linear regression. However, our findings do not provide clear results while indicating contrary effects on systematic and unsystematic risk instead, somehow reflecting the discrepancy of the current discourse on this topic.

In light of these changes, strategies have had to be redesigned to include the sustainability factor, which calls into question the extent of the impact of ESG factors on financial performance. Given the increasing trend in the number of papers and the total number of citations, the findings indicate that ESG is an emerging field in the study of sustainable economics, and the literature provides conflicting findings regarding this relationship. To analyze publication trends, citation patterns, and keyword mapping, the research used bibliometric analysis by applying VOSviewer software, highlighting the significance of the trend for the effects of sustainability on business, using research data collected from the Scopus online platform. The current article highlights recent findings that can be used to inform and direct future research on the impact of corporate social responsibility on financial performance.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether sustainability performance (SP) served as a safeguard for firm profitability (FP) and enhanced corporate resilience in emerging markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 1,091 firms in 25 emerging markets from 2017 to 2021, this study analyses the moderating role of SP on the relationship between FP and COVID-19 by using hierarchical linear modelling at three levels: (a) time-level; (b) firm-level; (c) country-level. Findings: The results indicate that during the years 2020–2021, emerging market firms with robust SP showed better FP in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also indicate that all dimensions of sustainability, i.e. environmental, social and governance (ESG), have significantly affected the FP in the post-COVID period. Hence, adhering to ESG principles aids in alleviating adverse financial repercussions during times of crises. Practical implications: This study provides valuable insights for companies and policymakers for finding solutions that may assist them in improving SP globally and enduring crises resiliently. The findings are also relevant to institutional investors that consider SP as an investment criteria. Although the COVID-19 pandemic was temporary, the lessons learned could protect firms from future similar global crises. Originality/value: This study enhances the understanding of the contingency relationship between sustainability and financial performance by offering up-to-date empirical insights within the context of emerging markets during the pandemic. It demonstrates how different institutional frameworks influenced the SP–FP association during the crisis. Thus, this paper expands the understanding of crisis management literature and bridges the research void concerning the impact of SP on FP in an emerging market context. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Even though a lot of research has been conducted world-wide concerning this issue, a conclusive result has not yet been derived. Being an emerging economy, India is at a nascent stage of research related to ESG issues, and past research indicates a mixed result. In order to avoid the potential endogeneity issue, this paper used a dynamic panel approach of system GMM. This paper considered data from 59 non-financial companies listed under the NSE 500 index. Data was collected from the Thomson Reuters Refinitiv Eikon database over a period of 11, spanning from 2010 to 2021. The finding suggested a significantly negative impact of ESG score on firm performance measured by Tobin's Q and ROA, which indicates a non-linear U-shaped relationship. Net profit margin and closing price are used as alternative, dependent variables to check the robustness of the models and show consistent results. The environmental pillar score and social pillar score showed a negative impact on firm performance, whereas the governance pillar score showed a positive impact on market performance but negatively impacted financial performance. The key takeaway from this paper is that, if firms continue to improve ESG disclosure, it will positively impact firm performance in the future. © 2024, University of Wollongong.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the extent of narrative disclosure in the sustainability-integrated reports of listed companies in the UAE and its effect of firm’ performances. In 2020, The Securities and Commodities Authority issued a circular requiring all public joint stock companies listed on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) or the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) to publish a sustainability report as part of their set of Integrated Reports. Design/methodology/approach: Using all publicly available sustainability integrated reports of listed companies in DFM and ADX over the period 2018–2022, we first gather the report’s content by compiling a list of words using a computational linguistic technique that aims to identify specific characteristics of sustainability reports. Then, we use a GLS model to study the effect of the sustainability reporting on firm financial performance and risk. Findings: The paper findings shows the level of sustainability disclosure of observed firms is noticeable. Besides, sustainability reporting has a significant effect on firm’s operational performance (ROA), financial performance (ROE) and market performance (Tobin’s Q). Nevertheless; it does not affect the financial risk. Research limitations/implications: Our study makes many contributions to the literature on corporate reporting. First, our analysis complements research that largely focuses on the financial disclosures in corporate reports by examining the sustainability-specific information and providing a full review of sustainability narratives. Second, by examining the effect of sustainability reports on shareholders' wealth, this article contributes to the current knowledge of sustainability reporting. Practical implications: Our research offers several practical implications to policymakers, management, shareholders in different ways. The outcomes of this study helps policymakers to assess the effect of the Securities and Commodities Authority circular on the extent of sustainability related information disclosed in the integrated-report. It also helps the government to understand the level of environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure per sectors. Besides, this research findings give insight to managers to understand the effect of ESG disclosed information in the sustainability integrated report on firm financial and market performances. In addition, the paper findings assure shareholders of the positive impact on sustainability integrated-report on firm performance.

We consider 12 scenarios involving the allocation of different weights to important ESG dimensions and use the TOPSIS multicriteria decision-making method to evaluate companies in Brazil. Findings: The results provide empirical evidence on the importance of balanced approach among the ESG dimensions and reflect the need for regulations and incentives to promote balanced ESG practices. We also identify companies with consistently good sustainability practices, such as Natura, those that deliver poor performance, such as Iochpe-Maxion S.A. and Azul S.A. Research limitations/implications: We contribute to the literature by integrating a multicriteria methodology into the assessment of corporate sustainability, demonstrating the effectiveness of TOPSIS in different scenarios. We emphasize the importance of balancing the ESG dimensions, and in doing so provide novel perspectives in research. Practical implications: Our findings offer a practical framework for managers to evaluate and refine their ESG strategies by using benchmarks from industry leaders.

	abstract = {Environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures maintain a sustainable strategic fit between the organization's goals and its changing environment and have an impact on the firm's ability to attract funds, gain competitiveness, and hence firm's financial performance (FFP). The objective of the present study is to evaluate the impact of environmental, social, and governance disclosures (ESGD) on firm financial performance (FFP), especially emphasizing the moderating role of firm internationalization. The study employed a panel dataset of 697 firms listed in the Asia-Pacific emerging economies from 2013 to 2022. The findings of the fixed effect and robust two-stage least square estimations reflect that the modern pillars of corporate social responsibility – ESGD-significantly and negatively influence FFP; however, the degrees of corporate internationalization (international intensity, geographical extensity) significantly and positively moderate the association between ESGD and FFP. The findings of the current study have several implications for regulatory bodies, practitioners, and administrative decision-making authorities in both government and corporations. We further recommend a course of action where an attempt can be made to encourage international trade that is best aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2024, Centre of Sociological Research.

However, the economic viability of these practices by companies is still controversial. Some studies confirm its positive impact on companies’ financial performance and value. Others highlight the high costs of its implementation, without a compensatory benefit. Furthermore, the level of countries’ development has a moderating effect on the adoption of these practices by organizations. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the impact of sustainable practices on the financial performance and value creation of companies, considering the moderating effect of the countries’ level of development. We analyzed, 355,416 observations from 2,509 companies located in 4 developed countries and 5 key partners of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The data was obtained from the Bloomberg, Capital IQ, and World Bank databases for the period from 2010 to 2022. The verification of these objectives was carried out via a hierarchical linear model or multilevel regression with panel data. As a result, there is confirmation of the positive impact of sustainable practices in adding value and improving the financial performance of organizations, especially for those located in emerging countries. © 2024 FEA-RP/USP.

In particular, it examines the interaction effect of ESG pressures on the relationship between SMEs’ environmental management capabilities and non-financial performance. For this study, a total of 1865 SME lists were obtained through Jeonnam Techno Park and Jeonnam Small Business Job and Economy Promotion Agency. Based on this, a total of 127 questionnaires were returned as a result of a telephone, e-mail, and online survey, and finally, an empirical analysis was conducted based on 120 questionnaires. We conducted an empirical analysis of Korean SMEs and obtained the following results: First, environmental management capabilities have a significant, positive effect on SMEs’ non-financial performance. Second, ESG pressure has a significant, negative effect on the non-financial performance of SMEs. Next, we analyzed the moderating effect of ESG pressures and observed that ESG pressures strengthen the positive effect of environmental management capabilities on non-financial performance. Based on the resource-based perspective and institutional theory, this study provides meaningful academic implications by examining environmental management capabilities and ESG pressures, which have not been identified in previous studies, as factors of non-financial performance that are becoming important under the new management paradigm, such as climate change and ESG. Furthermore, while ESG pressure has a significant negative effect on non-financial performance, we find that it is a moderating variable that strengthens the relationship between SMEs’ environmental management capabilities and non-financial performance, which has useful academic and practical implications for ESG and strategic management. © 2023 by author(s).},

This study aimed to ascertain if our findings aligned with the New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO) and Tripple Bottom Line/Quadruple Bottom Line (TBL/QBL) paradigms. We collected data from more than 600 financial institutions, including both Islamic and conventional banks, from 2005 to 2022. This study complements the literature by examining a wide range of years and banks in QISMUT + 3 countries, as well as investigating the impact of the number of internet users as proxied by fintech variable and ESG variables both on NPLs and profitability indicators in both Islamic and conventional banks in Islamic finance-oriented countries. In terms of persistence, traditional banks are superior to Islamic banks, and banks with sufficient capital are more competitive and efficient in generating profits. Islamic banks (IB) outperformed conventional banks (CB) during the global financial crisis; however, CB outperformed IB in terms of credit risk management. IBs compete more effectively than CBs do because they provide unique Sharia-compliant financial products. Furthermore, the ESG and fintech proxies play a significant role in determining bank asset quality and financial performance. The results are expected to improve the understanding of Islamic banking by bankers, investors, academics, and policymakers, as well as help in policy development for the banking industry in these countries. © 2024 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: The sample of this study includes 3,479 (firm-year) observations from 455 publicly traded U.S. manufacturing firms between 2003 and 2018. Utilizing data from ASSET4 ESG ratings, the Compustat, and the Execucomp databases for S&P 500 companies, we employ panel OLS regression analyses to test our hypotheses. Findings: We find a positive relationship between external ESG actions and firm value, and that internal ESG actions alone may not enhance firm value. We also find that customer awareness positively moderates both the relationship between external ESG actions and firm value, and the relationship between internal ESG actions and firm value. Research limitations/implications: This study extends the CSR-CFP relationship literature by discovering external actions of ESG influence firm value while internal ESG actions can be beneficial only when the focal firms are visible to a larger number of stakeholders. Our study suggests that a firm should publicize both types of its ESG actions to optimize their effectiveness. One limitation of this study is the potential oversight of certain aspects of top management teams and board diversity. Originality/value: The study provides a more in-depth understanding of ESG actions and their relationships to corporate financial performance, by adopting the concept of internal and external actions for ESG and examining the moderating role of customer awareness in the relationships. We found the beneficial interaction effects between ESG actions and customer awareness are more pronounced with external ESG actions, than with internal ESG actions. © 2024 People and Global Business Association and The Author(s).},

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement is employed to analyze the systematic literature review in this investigation. Data for the article were collected from Scopus and Web of Science databases spanning from 2000 to 2022. Both databases show consistent growth rates, with India being their top setting. This study reveals that quantitative techniques have been predominantly used in conducting investigations on this topic. With global emphasis on sustainable development and green economy, expectations of governments, regulators, corporations, and investment organizations have evolved beyond economic sustainability towards considering the well-being and responsibility of enterprises towards various stakeholders. Few scholars have utilized the PRISMA approach to analyze the impact of ESG on CFP; therefore, this study employs it to summarize how ESG ratings influence CFP as a reference for current research stage.

The analysis of special financial instruments in the aspect of instruments’ groups of project/corporate financing, stock market, loan capital market, and insurance market has been conducted in order to identify main trends and opportunities for further development; in particular, crowdfunding platforms are extremely advanced instruments. Based on the analysis of the statistical data, the article states that instruments of sustainable development financing have major potential on the financial market under the instability of economic situation. The objective of the article is to define the development opportunities for instruments of sustainable development financing based on the review and systematization of national and foreign literature and the analysis of the large amount of statistical data, as well as to develop recommendations to improve the methodological support of sustainable development financing. The article analyzes support programs and measures for development of sustainable development financing and considers a number of regulatory entitlements regulating this process. The analysis of the entrepreneurial sector of Saint Petersburg in the context of types of economic activity, including the dynamics of financial performance of economic entities and formed gross regional product, is presented. The results show that wholesale and retail trade occupy leading positions, both by quantity and by cumulative turnover. And the leading positions, according to ESG ranking of Russian companies, are occupied by oil and gas industry. However, it should not be forgotten that the main type of activity for many companies in this sphere is trade. Opportunities for the development of financing instruments have been identified and recommendations for improving the methodological support of sustainable development financing have been developed, including the need for improvement of the system of companies’ evaluation during registration on crowdfunding platforms, expanding expansionary and supportive measures and the use of artificial intelligence in finance, etc. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

The study has also explored the influence of managerial ability and institutional quality as moderating variables on the relation between ESG and the financial performance of firms (both measures of FP: Tobin’s Q and ROA). Design/methodology/approach: The study is quantitative exploratory and uses panel data of 687 publicly listed companies from the year 2013–2023. Data has been acquired from the reputed data providers and OLS regression has been used for panel data analysis with fixed effects. Findings: The study reaffirms the positive impact of ESG on the financial performance of firms. Each pillar of ESG (environmental, social, and governance) has been found positively related to both measures of financial performance (Tobin’s Q and ROA). The study reveals that managerial ability and institutional quality, acting as supplementary variables, moderate the relationship between ESG and financial performance of firms. Research limitations/implications: A limited sample comprising data from only 687 firms was used for the analysis. The latest data was not available, therefore, data from 2013 to 2023 was used in the study. Practical implications: This study indicates that ESG practices, which are mostly discretionary in Emerging Economies, can be induced through institutional pressures and ensuring higher quality managers. Policymakers in government institutions have to determine the inefficiencies, corrupt practices, and inconsistencies in policies that lower the effectiveness of institutions making them business-unfriendly. At the organizational level, policymakers need to ensure that responsible positions in the organization are held by managers with higher managerial ability. It is also to be ensured by shareholders that managers do not over-invest in ESG-related projects, particularly in organizations with weaker financial status. For managers, it is important to understand the positive benefits associated with ESG, even though they are in the long term. Social implications: In Emerging Economies, the official monitoring and regulatory mechanisms are weak, and lack a supportive attitude toward ESG initiatives. Voluntary and proactive firm-level environmental and social initiatives need to be encouraged and rewarded by institutions with public acknowledgment. ESG should be given priority by organizations for improving the quality of services and better social impact of businesses on society. Originality/value: Most of the past research explored the impact of ESG on financial performance in advanced countries or in emerging markets in a single/limited number of countries or industries. Also, past studies investigated the impact of institutional quality and managerial ability on ESG/financial performance in separate models. Conversely, this study has used a multi-country and multi-industry sample for more generalizable findings. Against the backdrop of the institutional environment of Emerging Economies, the study extends Institutional Theory and Upper Echelon Theory to include the role of managerial ability and institutional quality in the relationship between ESG and firms’ financial performance. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

While previous research has viewed this connection as direct, this study proposes an indirect relationship. Drawing on agency theory, property rights theory, and a resource-based view, we argue that employee stock ownership fosters enhanced financial performance. Additionally, building on existing theoretical and empirical literature, we hypothesise a positive association between CSR and FFP. Our analysis of panel data from 72 listed French companies (2010-2020) confirms a significant relationship between ESO and FFP. Moreover, our findings suggest CSR acts as a partial mediator in this relationship. These results shed light on how ESO and financial performance interact, with CSR playing a mediating role.

The findings are as follows: (1) businesses are more likely to engage in earnings management practices if their annual reports contain a higher percentage of positive phrases; (2) the optimistic disclosure tone of annual reports was found to have a negative correlation with independent directors and gender diversity; (3) a strong positive correlation exists between positive disclosure tone and firm value, with profitability as measured by return on assets supporting this association; (4) financial performance was shown to determine tone, rather than the other way around; (5) companies used a positive tone when there was no risk of bankruptcy while reducing their use of negative tones; and (6) the study demonstrated that disclosure tone, particularly negative and litigious tones, had distinct associations with the cost of capital and its components. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.},

	abstract = {Prior studies have explored the link between ESG ratings and firms' financial performance, but few have focused on its interplay with investor sentiment. This study examines how investor sentiment moderates the relationship between ESG ratings and financial performance. We use a fixed-effect regression model applied to panel data from Chinese listed firms from 2011 to 2020. We find strong evidence that investor sentiment can reinforce the impact of ESG ratings on financial performance. We further investigate how investor sentiment moderates the relationships between the dimensions of ESG—environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G)—performance, and financial performance, respectively. Evidence shows that investor sentiment can enhance the negative impact of E on financial performance, while it enhances the positive impacts of S and G on financial performance. Our results are robust across various econometric techniques, including generalised-least-squares regression, first-difference regression, and system-generalised method of moments estimation. We provide insights for firm managers on leveraging investor sentiment to enhance ESG strategies to improve financial performance and offer implications for policymakers in crafting effective regulations that account for investor sentiment dynamics. © 2024 Crawford School of Public Policy, The Australian National University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.},

This event-study research is based on data from developed and emerging stock markets: the NYSE (US) and the WSE (Poland). The improvement in corporate reputation is proxied by its inclusion in a reputational index. We analysed inclusions in the RESPECT Index and WIG-ESG in Poland from 2009 to 2023. Then we compared the effects of inclusions on stock prices in the Polish market and the US market, in which the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) was applied. Our findings suggest that in the emerging Polish market, significant reaction to inclusion in the index persists even when the sectoral circumstances are considered. Contrarily, in the developed US market, the strong positive effect of inclusion disappears in the sectoral context. Hence, significant returns may not be driven by the inclusion in a reputational index but rather result from other events that affect the particular sector. © 2024, Centre of Sociological Research.

This paper adds to the increasing body of research on ESG performance in emerging markets by arguing that to promote deeper ESG integration, there is a need for increased regulatory support as well as investor education. The increasing influence of global sustainability norms necessitates an understanding of these dynamics within emerging markets such as Vietnam to align corporate strategies with investor expectations and international standards.

The fashion industry exemplifies this effort, with an increasing number of companies embracing sustainability and ethical practices. In this context, our purpose is to provide a clear and comprehensive picture of the link between sustainability and business performance in the fashion industry. This work presents a Multivariate Regression Analysis, scrutinizing both external perspectives through stock prices and internal perspectives via profitability indices. Our aim is to discern the intricate relationship between sustainability practices and financial performance within the fashion industry, aligning ESG criteria with long-term economic success. Our regression analysis reveals a significant positive correlation between ESG scores and stock prices, indicating investor recognition of ESG performance as a crucial investment criterion. However, when focusing internally on profitability, the ESG score does not exhibit statistical significance, suggesting a yet-to-be-established connection between ESG policies and corporate profitability. This study underscores the evolving role of companies as sustainability promoters, emphasizing the crucial role of ESG performance in shaping investor perceptions. Nevertheless, it also highlights the need for further exploration into the intricate relationship between sustainable policies and corporate profitability. As businesses increasingly embrace sustainability, in fact, it could become paramount for informed decision-making and fostering ethical societal and environmental progress. © 2024 by author(s).},

	abstract = {The study evaluates the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting performance of public sector banks (PSBs) and private sector banks (PvtBs) in India. Additionally, it seeks to investigate the impact of ESG performance on the financial performance (FP) of 32 companies during the 2022 financial year. Data on ESG performance were gathered from CRISIL (formerly Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited) reports, while FP data were obtained from the companies’ annual reports. The assessment of FP utilized accounting and market-based measures, and empirical exploration was conducted using ordinary least square (OLS) regression. The Mann-Whitney U test and box plot were employed to evaluate significant variations in ESG performance between PSBs and PvtBs. The findings suggest that Indian banking companies prioritize governance and social aspects over environmental concerns (Kumar & Prakash, 2019) and highlight unequal ESG performance between PSBs and PvtBs. Furthermore, the study indicates that ESG performance significantly and positively impacts FP across accounting and market measures (Ersoy et al., 2022). The implications of these findings are pertinent to regulators and policymakers, emphasizing the importance of transparent and comprehensive ESG disclosure for informed decision-making and the fulfilment of societal responsibilities. The present study examining the nexus between ESG performance and FP is confined to selected banks for a single financial year due to limited access to reliable data. © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Can retail investors revolutionize corporate governance and make public companies more responsive to social concerns? Beginning in 2021, there was a dramatic influx of retail investors into the shareholder base of “meme” stock companies such as GameStop, AMC, and Bed Bath & Beyond. Observing the unprecedented, coordinated trading among retail investors, scholars and practitioners predicted that the influx of retail investors would reduce the power of large institutional investors and democratize corporate governance. These predictions were driven by three factors: generational, with assumptions that millennial and Gen Z investors would challenge corporate management; societal, reflecting growing discontent with slow progress on issues such as sustainability and boardroom diversity; and technological, with the advent of easily accessible and user-friendly mobile apps allowing investors to directly intervene in corporate governance. While plausible, these predictions have so far not been tested. This Article empirically analyzes the impact of retail investors on corporate governance, particularly at meme stock companies. We provide new quantitative evidence regarding the origins of meme investing and conclude that—despite their coordinated trading behavior in the market—meme investors have not democratized corporate governance or advanced social issues. The Article presents three principal findings. First, we show how the “meme stock” frenzy was affected by the abolition of trading commissions by major brokerages in 2019. Meme stock companies experienced positive abnormal stock returns when commission-free trading was widely introduced and saw elevated trading volumes afterward. Second, we find that despite the promise of a more active retail shareholder base, meme stock companies experienced a significant decrease in shareholder voting. Shareholder proposals have also been very limited, with most meme stock companies seeing no proposals after the rapid rise in retail ownership. Third, we do not find any improvement in meme stock companies’ corporate governance, financial performance, and social responsibility, as represented by director independence, board gender diversity, ESG scores, and capital and R&D expenditures. Collectively, our findings suggest that the influx of retail shareholders has not translated into more “democratic” governance regimes or encouraged shareholder participation in corporate governance at companies most affected by the meme investor storm. © 2024 University of Southern California.

This paper aims to analyze the financial impact of women in executive positions in German companies by examining the economic value added and exploring the effects of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors and female supervisory board members on female board members. The results indicate that in the 200 largest German companies, the share of female executives increased between 2018 and 2022. Regardless of industry, female executives started at very low levels at around 4% in 2018; in 2022, this figure reached around 11%. Thereby, the financial sector showed the highest share of female executives at around 14% in 2022, and the industrial sector at around 9%. A closer look reveals that large companies have higher shares of female executives than smaller companies. Large companies show an average of 17% compared to small ones, and in 2022, only 8%. There is a positive correlation between the share of female supervisory board members and female executives, arguing that female supervisory board members seem to hire more female executives. Companies with more female executives tend to have lower ESG controversy scores, and companies with more female executives, measured by the economic value added, perform better financially than companies with few or no women. Companies with female executives show about 2 percentage points higher economic value added than those with the lowest share of females (no or few female executives). Thus, it seems that female executives matter and make a difference in companies. © Felix Roessle, Carolin Fleischmann, Kathrin Roessle, 2024.},

Methodology: For our empirical analysis, 18 firms were selected for data observations. After correlation, regression, multicollinearity, and Hausman tests, we decided to apply the feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) method. Originality: This study is a response to the huge growth in fintech technologies in the CIS region and their implementation in the telecom industry. As of this writing, only a few studies have been conducted on this topic for CIS-region countries. Furthermore, the research in this chapter was conducted to determine and understand the variables that have impacted profitability. Findings: This study shows that a negative impact on profitability comes from leverage, while a positive effect has been achieved via liquidity, and both are significant to the profitability of a firm. GDP has a significant negative effect; on the other hand, size has a positive but not significant effect on profitability. Overall, companies should maintain their leverage and liquidity and not forget about macroeconomic factors when budgeting and planning their financial performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This research aims to investigate the relationship between environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and the performance of real estate companies before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. By conducting a comprehensive case study analysis, we will explore how real estate companies' adoption of ESG practices has influenced their financial performance, market value and resilience during these uncertain times. The findings of this study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge on the relationship between ESG factors and company performance, specifically within the real estate sector. Moreover, the research outcomes will offer practical implications for real estate companies, investors, policymakers and other stakeholders, aiding them in making informed decisions regarding ESG integration and its potential benefits in uncertain times. Overall, this research aims to shed light on whether ESG factors truly enhance the performance of real estate companies, considering the unique challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and sanctions. By examining the case study before and during uncertain times including COVID-19 pandemic and sanctions, we provide valuable insights into the role of ESG practices in shaping the future of the real estate industry. Design/methodology/approach: The study focuses on the selection process and main model used to investigate the relationship between ESG factors and firm performance. The data is divided into four groups based on ESG quartiles to analyze differences between firms with high and low ESG scores. The Difference-in-Differences (DID) model is employed to assess anomalous returns and stock volatility across different ESG quartiles before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Panel data models are utilized to study the association between ESG and firm performance, with random effects and fixed effects estimators considered. The study builds a model to analyze the impact of ESG on financial performance indicators, incorporating various factors and control variables. Additionally, the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATET) analysis and DID model are explored to evaluate the causal impact of ESG on firm performance. The study emphasizes the importance of testing for parallel trends to ensure the validity of the ATET analysis and it presents a generalized DID model to examine the relationship between ESG scores and company performance outcomes. Findings: Our study's main conclusions show that, in a world with some degree of stability, ESG not only does not improve but, in some situations, also hurts firms' success. On the other hand, at times of notable worldwide unrest, like the COVID-19 pandemic, firms with better ESG ratings demonstrate exceptional stock market success and a noteworthy ability to rebound from a crisis. Moreover, we note that investors truly prioritize sustainable investments as a risk mitigation strategy in addition to their environmental and social duties only when companies face sufficiently significant risks. The results will highlight the significance of sustainable and responsible investment for investors and provide management with more knowledge to create effective ESG strategies for their companies. Practical implications: By incorporating sustainability and responsibility into their operations, businesses may reduce risk, perform better over the long run and benefit society and the environment. As investors come to understand the importance of ESG issues in their decision-making, the global landscape is experiencing a transformation. Therefore, in the era when stakeholders, such as consumers, workers and shareholders, want more responsibility and transparency when it comes to ESG practises, it is crucial that companies should devote their priority to their ESG performance in order to reduce the danger of slipping behind, especially in light of the increasing importance of sustainability issues and changing laws. However, in the case of small-sized firms, investment policies to improve companies’ governance need to be controlled in moderation during the period of stability because it will create financial pressure and leave them without enough resources to cope with negative impacts during uncertain period. In sum, sustainable and ethical investment is not only a fad; rather, it is a vital and unavoidable route for companies looking to prosper in an unpredictable and complicated global environment. Originality/value: This research study significantly enhances the existing academic discourse surrounding the relationship between ESG factors and firm performance, particularly, in periods of uncertainty. The findings underscore the critical importance for real estate companies to place a greater emphasis on ESG practices in order to not only benefit themselves but also to improve their overall performance and sustainability in the long term. By shedding light on the positive outcomes associated with prioritizing ESG considerations, this study offers valuable insights for real estate firms seeking to enhance their competitive advantage and stakeholder value in today's dynamic business landscape. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This research aims to address a gap in the literature by examining the influence of board diversity (BD) in terms of board independence (BI) and gender diversity (GD) (i.e., female directors) on corporate ESG performance (ESGP), specifically considering the moderating effect of these two variables on the relationship between corporate profitability (CP) and ESGP. The analysis is based on a dataset encompassing 126 firm-year observations from 30 Saudi non-financial public listed companies spanning the period from 2013 to 2022. The results of the direct models show that CP has an insignificant negative impact, while BD, particularly in terms of independent directors and female directors, enhances ESGP. Moreover, the results from the moderation models indicate that while BI does not show a statistically significant positive impact on the relationship, GD demonstrates an insignificant negative effect on ESGP. © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study seeks to investigate the impact of sustainability reporting index, particularly focusing on non-primary consumer goods, on stock returns during the period of 2018 to 2022, with a specific emphasis on the COVID-19 pandemic period. By analyzing the relationship between sustainability reporting and stock returns, the research aims to provide insights into the resilience and stability of companies in the face of market volatility induced by the COVID-19 crisis, particularly in the Indonesian stock market. Methods: The research methodology involves the application of multiple linear regression, incorporating dummy variables to empirically test the influence of sustainability reporting index on company stock returns during the COVID-19 event. Data collection entails gathering sustainability report data from each company within the non-primary consumer goods sector. Statistical analysis techniques are used to assess the impact of sustainability performance on stock return volatility and stability during the specified time period. Results and Discussion: The findings of the study reveal that firms within the non-primary consumer goods sector experienced substantial impacts on their leverage and profitability during the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly influencing stock returns. Notably, companies with strong performance in ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) aspects demonstrate relatively stable stock prices amidst the epidemic. However, the analysis indicates that social reporting index performance exhibits higher volatility in stock prices compared to other ESG components. Moreover, the study observes a minimal increase in stock return volatility for companies with good ESG performance. Implications of the Research: The research outcomes have important implications for investors, policymakers, and corporate stakeholders, particularly in understanding the role of sustainability reporting in mitigating stock return volatility during times of crisis. The study underscores the significance of integrating ESG considerations into investment decisions and corporate strategies to enhance resilience and stability in the face of market disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the research provides policy recommendations for government intervention through fiscal incentives to promote ESG investment and sustainable corporate practices. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the literature by examining the impact of sustainability reporting index on stock returns within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly focusing on the non-primary consumer goods sector in Indonesia. By providing empirical evidence of the relationship between ESG performance and stock return volatility during a period of crisis, the research offers valuable insights into the role of sustainability reporting in driving investor confidence and market stability.

Using a sample of 270 firm-year observations, the study employs pooled OLS regression to analyze the impact of sustainability reporting on return on assets (ROA) and earnings per share (EPS). The findings reveal that economic and environmental sustainability reporting have significant positive relationships with both financial performance measures, while social sustainability reporting shows no significant impact. Environmental reporting emerges as the strongest predictor of financial performance, suggesting that environmental initiatives create value through multiple channels, including operational efficiency and market recognition. The study contributes to the literature by providing the first empirical evidence from Bangladesh's textile industry, offering insights for policymakers and corporate leaders in emerging economies. While the findings support stakeholder and legitimacy theories, the study's limitations include its focus on a single industry and reliance on secondary data. The research implications suggest that firms should prioritize environmental and economic sustainability reporting while developing more effective approaches to social sustainability practices that can demonstrate clear financial benefits.

The study contributes to the existing literature in providing an empirical evidence for a regional analysis in developing countries, particularly in Southeast Asia and extending the existing models by incorporating macroeconomic and COVID-19 variables. The study estimates the impact of ESG score on financial performance using the Fixed Effect Model from the panel data comprising 225 listed companies in the six countries in the Southeast Asia including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines in three years from 2020 to 2022. The statistics implies the ESG practices in Southeast Asia still insufficient and significant variations among enterprises. A one-year lagged ESG variable has a significantly positive impact on financial performance. The COVID-19 infection rate has a significant negative impact on the return on asset (ROA); meanwhile, the ROA experiences a slight increase with a rise in GDP growth. The results also enhance our understanding of ESG investments and underscores their importance in shaping investment choices, especially in rapidly developing Southeast Asian economies, where prioritizing ESG factors is crucial for sustainable development. © 2024 The Author(s).

The study uses various risk-adjusted performance measures such as Sharpe ratio, Jensen alpha, Treynor ratio, Information ratio, Modified Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and Omega ratio to analyze the performance of SRI indices. The period of analysis extends from January 2018 to December 2021. The study performs various sub-period analyses including a crisis period analysis to assess the impact of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) crisis on the performance of select indices. Statistical tests such as the paired t-test and Levene’s F test are applied to examine the homogeneity of means and variances of sample indices. Robustness checks involve calculating performance metrics across varying sample sizes using a growing window procedure. The results highlight the outperformance of SRI indices over market benchmarks in India, the US, and the UK, suggesting that investors do not have to forgo financial performance to address their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns. There is no statistically significant outcome observed for SRI performance in China. Empirical evidence from the crisis period analysis indicates that SRI can offer investors a hedge against market volatility. Overall, the findings suggest that there is no homogenous or universal outcome of SRI but rather varies depending on geographic region, study period, current market conditions, and extent of SRI adoption. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {Orientation: The allocation of incentives based on corporate financial performance is a longstanding phenomenon aimed at aligning the interests of executives and shareholders. Yet, given rising social and environmental concerns, shareholders are increasingly pressuring companies to link sustainability matters to executive compensation. Research purpose: Disclosures on the linkages between executive remuneration and sustainability considerations were explored in South Africa, a country that is notorious for income inequality. Motivation for the study: Despite offering a well-developed corporate governance framework, South Africa experiences several social ills. If pay-performance linkages are expanded to include sustainability considerations, directors will by implication be encouraged to focus on sustainable value creation. Research design, approach and method: Content analysis was conducted on the 2019 and 2022 integrated and remuneration reports of selected banks and telecommunications companies operating in South Africa. Focus was placed on how these companies have linked sustainability aspects to incentives over the short and long term. Main findings: Improvements were noted in terms of linking sustainability considerations to executive pay. Most companies related social aspects to short-term incentives. Yet, environmental pay-performance linkages warrant more attention. Practical and/or managerial implications: Remuneration and social and ethics committee members should reflect on how executive pay can be optimally linked to material sustainability considerations. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) could be used to develop fairer and more responsible director pay policies. Contribution and/or value-add: The considered companies progressively accounted for sustainability aspects when determining executive pay in a highly unequal country. Directors are thus increasingly rewarded for ensuring a more sustainable future. © 2024. The Authors.},

Despite its importance, limited attention has been given to the relationship between ESG performance and the cost of debt (COD) and whether board traits influence this relationship. Therefore, this study addresses this gap by analyzing the moderating influence of board size and independence on the relationship between ESG performance and the cost of debt using a two-way interaction approach. We also investigate whether board diversity (i.e., age, gender, education, and culture) complements board size and independence in strengthening the negative relationship between ESG performance and COD using the three-way interaction approach. The study employed two-stage least squares and two-step GMM estimation techniques using a sample of Chinese non-financial firms. The two-way interaction results suggest that large and independent boards have a moderating effect and influence the negative relationship between ESG and COD. Furthermore, the three-way interaction results suggest that board diversity complements large and independent boards by strengthening the negative impact of ESG on COD. This effect of board diversity is present when the board of directors possesses age, gender, educational, and cultural diversity. Interestingly, our analysis also indicates that ESG performance is beneficial for both environmentally sensitive and non-sensitive firms but has more profound benefits for environmentally sensitive firms. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

It has been found that among other board characteristics, women on the board and the presence of CSR committee have a significant positive impact on ESG performance.

The analysis uses data for 8094 enterprises sampled from Asia and Europe between 2016 and 2021 that was gathered from secondary sources and taken from the Refinitiv Eikon database. According to the findings, proactive environmental investments, fines, and environmental expenses associated with ESG reporting are positively correlated. The findings also show that European businesses disclose environmental information at a higher degree than Asian businesses, which benefits their sustainability initiatives. Furthermore, sustainability indices have an adverse relationship with ESG reporting in Asia but a positive relationship with ESG reporting in Europe. Crucially, the findings show that various industries have varied relationships between sustainability reporting and environmental indicators. The study provides valuable insights for policymakers by highlighting the extent to which enterprises disclose their emissions, innovations, and resource use. Additionally, the study offers evidence on the role of corporate board members and how certain board characteristics as important mechanisms can improve the quality of ESG reporting making environmental disclosures useful and relevant. © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {ESG (environmental, social, and governance) practices, an internationally recognized concept of a firm's sustainability, can serve as a bridge to enhance effective communication between firms and various stakeholders. It is also a new tool for measuring firms' value. This study employs a balanced panel data set of 114 publicly traded agricultural and food firms in China from 2016 to 2022. It empirically investigates the relationship between ESG and financial performance based on shareholder primacy theory and stakeholder theory. Employing a two-way fixed effects (FE) model, our findings reveal a U-shaped nonlinear pattern in how ESG impacts financial performance. It differs from previous studies that found predominantly positive relationships: Specifically, the average ESG score for firms is 0.396, the median is 0.390, and the inflection point of the U-shape occurs at 0.53. When firms' ESG investments are less than 0.53, the high initial ESG cost makes it difficult to transform ESG into financial improvement. However, once this threshold is surpassed, good ESG can convey an excellent reputation to the public and increase anti-risk ability—which, in turn, significantly improves firms' financial performance and facilitates long-term development. Also, our study demonstrates that firms' ownership and different positions in the supply chain differentially affect the relationship between ESG and financial performance. This paper also offers insights into promoting the sustainable development of Chinese agri-food firms. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

Data on the ESG performance and ROA of Indian banks are anal ysed in this paper to regulate banking sector and improvise banking software using a range of statistical methodologies (Regression model using Python). According to the research's results, there is a connection between a bank's ROA and its ESG score. As a result, banks tend to have greater ROAs when they have lower ESG scores. The analysis alsore ve als that banks that are more vulnerable to environmental risks correlate more significantly with their ESG score and ROA. The research's conclusions affect bank management, investors, and bank regulators. The results imply that regulators would find it helpful to consider ESG performance when determining how risky banks are. According to the findings, investors may find it be neficial to use ESG performance to select banks with outstanding financial performance.

	abstract = {Market turmoil caused by COVID-19 has weakened firms’ financial performance, highlighting the prominence of sustainable business practices by incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance performance and their disclosure. Though past studies investigated COVID-19’s impact on firm performance, there is consensus on the role of firms’ Environmental, Social, and Governance disclosures between firm performance and the pandemic. With this view, the study aims to examine the impact of COVID-19 on firms’ financial performance with the moderating role of Environmental, Social, and Governance performance disclosure. To do so, the study retrieved data of Nifty 500 index companies from the Bloomberg database for a sample period ranging from 2016 to 2022. To this end, the study performed the fixed-effect regression and GMM model. The findings reveal a significant negative impact of the pandemic on Return on Assets (β =-4.812), Return on Equity (β =–.675), and Earnings Per Share (β = –2.875), highlighting the unfavorable effect of the pandemic on firm performance. Further results showed that firms’ Environmental, Social, and Governance performance disclosure positively moderates the connection between COVID-19 and Return on Assets (β = 3.231), Return on Equity (β = 0.032), and Earnings Per Share (β = 1.523), respectively. This indicates that companies actively involved in Environmental, Social, and Governance disclosure are less likely to suffer during the pandemic in terms of financial performance due to their ESG disclosures. © G.

Using 909 company-level data, we applied Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to measure CE. We examined how these efficiency scores and CFP viz., Return on Assets (ROA), market value, and profit after tax (PAT) are influenced at different levels of ESG. To provide variational and distributional aspects, we employed quantile regression to estimate the relationship between ESG, CE, and CFP across different quantiles. The findings indicated that the impact of ESG integration on efficiency and CFP positively varies across quantiles. Further, a non-linear U-shaped relationship is established between the overall ESG score, environmental score, and social score with the CE. The efficiency initially dips at a lower disclosure score and surges to its highest at a higher disclosure score. Finally, our results revealed that ESG integration brings CE, which in turn channeled into financial outcomes, suggesting that CE plays a crucial mediating role. These results contribute to the understanding of how ESG practices can be leveraged for better financial outcomes through CE. These findings provide companies and policymakers with vital direction, encouraging a focus on robust ESG disclosure in establishing the path toward long-term corporate sustainability and profitability, guided by improved CE. © 2024, American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

We perform the analysis in two stages, in the first stage, we examine the impact of ESG score on firm performance. The findings show that ESG score has a negative impact on operational and financial performance and a positive effect on market performance. Next, we hypothesize that ESG will have a more positive and stronger impact on firm performance in high than low climate risk countries. The results indicate mixed evidence. In further analysis, we have examined the effect of environmental performance index and net zero initiatives on the relationship of ESG on firm performance. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The rapid changes in interest rates experienced during and following the COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges for management committed to enhancing the ESG strategies of firms. This study explores how interest rates moderate the relationship between ESG factors and firm performance within the US restaurant sector. Using 240 observations from US publicly-traded restaurant firms, regression analyses are conducted using Tobin’s q as the dependent variable, incorporating interaction terms between each of the environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) factors with interest rates as moderating variables. The findings indicate that interest rates significantly amplify the impacts of the environmental (E) and social (S) factors on company performance but do not significantly moderate the effect of the governance (G) factor on performance. This research enriches the hospitality and tourism literature by providing novel insights into the interplay between ESG factors and restaurant firms’ performance, particularly under varying interest rate conditions. Additionally, this study offers practical guidance to management in the restaurant industry, suggesting that restaurant firms should intensify their environmental and social initiatives in response to rising interest rates to enhance their financial performance. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study is the analysis of the ABNT NBR ISO 14001:2015 standard - Environmental Management Systems in organizations of the Electricity Sector as a strategic tool to answer the Environmental Questionnaire of the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE B3 - main index for the evaluation of ESG practices in the Stock Exchange. Theoretical Framework: The theoretical framework of this work is based on fundamental concepts of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance), Environmental Management Systems and Corporate Sustainability. In addition, the research considers the hypothesis of the correlation between the implementation of ISO 14001 and a better performance in ISE B3. Stakeholder Theory and Corporate Social Responsibility Theory are relevant to understanding why companies should adopt sustainable practices and how this can influence their performance and reputation. Method: The methodology adopted for this research was qualitative, characterized as exploratory. A comparative documentary study was carried out between the requirements of ISO 14001 and the Questionnaire of the Environment Dimension of the Corporate Sustainability Index. The conformity and correlation between the items of ISO 14001 and the questions of the ISE B3 Questionnaire were evaluated, weighting them in three degrees of applicability. Results and Discussion: The results obtained highlight the strong correlation between ISO 14001 certification and compliance with the ISE B3 Questionnaire in the Environmental Dimension. In addition to adding value to operations and maintenance on environmental issues, ISO 14001 certification provides companies in the electricity sector with a competitive advantage by obtaining higher scores in sustainability indices. The adoption of an ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System provides a structured path to environmental alignment and the incorporation of environmental management into the corporate sustainability strategy. Research Implications: The practical and theoretical implications of this research highlight the importance of ISO 14001 certification as a strategy to meet the environmental demands of the financial market, highlighting the need to consider environmental, social and governance aspects for holistic business management in the electricity sector. These implications can encompass ISO standards and ESG criteria, environmental and business standards, as well as providing practical guidance for companies in formulating strategies that improve their performance and financial reputation. Originality/Value: This study contributes significantly to the research by presenting an innovative approach in the analysis of the ABNT NBR ISO 14001:2015 standard and its impact on the response to the Environmental Questionnaire of the Corporate Sustainability Index in the Electricity Sector. The results provide valuable insights into how Generation and Transmission companies can improve their environmental performance and sustainability index scores.

Design/methodology/approach: Using ordinary least-squares and two-stage least squares (2SLS) regressions, and retrieving ESG disclosure data from Bloomberg’s database, the paper analyses a sample of European nonfinancial listed firms (1,935 firm-year observations) over the period 2014–2022. The study adopts board independence and board cultural diversity as structural and demographic board attributes that characterize the corporate governance environment in which female directors operate; the enforcement of law and gender equality as country-related institutional and cultural factors. Findings: Results suggest that female directors may substitute board independence in improving ESG and governance disclosure, whilst they co-occur with board cultural diversity in increasing ESG, governance and social disclosure. Findings indicate that the enforcement of law increases the positive effect of female directors on environmental disclosure and lowers the impact on governance disclosure. Conversely, a more gender-equal environment enhances female directors’ engagement in improving governance disclosure, reducing their beneficial effect on environmental information. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature suggesting that structural and other demographic board contextual aspects, as well as institutional and cultural country-related contextual factors, affect the relationship between board gender diversity and ESG disclosure differently and the effect may vary depending on ESG disclosure. © 2024, Giovanna Gavana, Pietro Gottardo and Anna Maria Moisello.},

The findings of this paper on the factors potentially related to employee productivity are human capital, management board diversity, improvement in health, and improvement in quality issues. It is recommended that the management of organizations implement constructive solutions for the wellness of employees to enhance overall employee productivity. The search results showed that some of the factors such as management board duties (women) and quality issues on supply chain management were cited the most frequently with 3192 and 2706 times, correspondingly, while employee productivity (men) was cited less frequently in comparison. This is managerially relevant to organizations which are working on sustainable development (SD) with employee productivity and organizational effectiveness.

The nexus between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics and financial performance has garnered significant attention from academics, corporations, executives, and regulators in the present era. In addition, this study investigates whether board activity moderates the relationship between ESG controversies and bank performance. This study adopts a quantitative approach and employs a cross-country sample of 54 banks with 540 bank-year observations from 2013 to 2022. The data were compiled from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) database and examined using panel data regression techniques. The findings indicate that the ESG controversies have a notable adverse effect on the performance of banks, as measured by Tobin's Q. Interestingly, the study discovered that board activity alleviates the negative influence of ESG controversies on bank performance. These empirical findings aid investors and managers in assessing the impact of ESG controversies and board activity on bank performance. Moreover, the empirical findings can aid bank managers in implementing a proactive governance-oriented approach. Particularly, board activity should be regarded as a method to reduce the negative effects of ESG controversies on performance.  © 2024 AESS Publications. All Rights Reserved.},

This study considers the three strands of corporate governance, thus board’s structural, diversity and process attributes, which have not been considered in prior studies. The study employed the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CCEMG) and the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) for the empirical analysis. The study utilized a quantitative research methodology sourcing data from 362 manufacturing companies from Sub-Saharan Africa from 2010 to 2022. The findings indicate that regarding board diversity attributes, both gender diversity and the presence of foreign nationals exhibit positive associations with FV. Regarding board structural attributes, independent boards and board size also influenced FV positively. However, CEO duality shows a negative assosciation with FV. Regarding the process attributes, holding regular board meetings enhances FV, while low meeting attendance negatively affects FV. Moreover, the study also evidenced that ESG performance exerts a substantial positive impact on the link between CG and FV. The findings underscore the need for policymakers to enact stringent regulations compelling firms to integrate ESG principles into their governance structures, as it enhances firm value. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Pension funds’ investments are increasingly linked to the changes in climate and environmental protection. The integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into their investment process is still varying in different countries and regions. The limited number of studies on the application of the ESG investment approach by private pension funds in Bulgaria shows that the country lags behind the trends in Europe. Although pension funds do not perceive environmental investments as riskier or less profitable than conventional ones, many of them remain cautious due to the shorter-term financial performance data of green assets. To achieve adequate retirement savings and a high replacement rate saving “more and for longer” is not enough. As far as the topic of portfolio investment performance is on the agenda, one would reasonably ask what the reflection of environmental investments would be on the widely diversified portfolios of pension funds in the country. The present research is dedicated to а mean-variance (MV) portfolio optimization involving a selection of conventional and green assets under different constraints and “shades of green” by using historical data. The empirical results from the portfolio optimizations performed shed light on the questions raised and complement the motivational spectrum “in favour of” or “against” environmental investment. © 2024, Bulgarska Akademiya na Naukite.

Over the last three years, ESG agenda developed at a more rapid pace on the emerging markets than on the developed ones. Methods: Utilizing data from 200 companies from 8 different industries: chemical, energy, transport, metals and mining, telecommunication, oil and gas, real estate, and retail trade industries, authors employs correlation and regression analyses to ascertain the effects of ESG factors on companies' profitability and investment attractiveness. Results: It can be stated that components of an ESG rating can affect a company’s financial performance, such as profitability and the company’s investment attractiveness with different magnitude and any changes (increase or decrease) in E, S or G components can influence company financial performance: either in positive or negative way. Conclusion: The study concludes that while ESG factors generally contribute to improved financial outcomes, their specific impact varies across different industries, highlighting the importance of industry-specific strategies for integrating ESG considerations into business practices. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the opportunities and risks associated with investing in the green economy. Key sectors examined include renewable energy (solar, wind, and bioenergy), sustainable agriculture, electric vehicles, energy efficiency technologies, waste management, and carbon capture solutions. The analysis explores how these sectors are benefiting from global trends such as climate change mitigation policies, corporate commitments to carbon neutrality, technological innovations, and growing consumer demand for sustainable products and services. On the opportunity side, investors stand to gain from significant market growth, government incentives, and regulatory frameworks such as carbon pricing and renewable energy targets. For example, renewable energy is becoming more cost-competitive with fossil fuels, and electric vehicle sales are projected to rise as countries phase out internal combustion engines. Green bonds and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria have also opened new financing channels for green projects, providing investors with diversified portfolios that align financial performance with positive environmental impact. © 2024, Gnedenko Forum.

	abstract = {Purpose: With the recent conclusion of the United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP) 28 in the United Arab Emirates, this study aims to investigate the tweeting behaviour of firms surrounding COP events. The authors analyse the environmental, social and governance (ESG) tweets from the COP 26 and COP 27 events, aiming to deepen the understanding of the complex relationships between social media communication, industry characteristics and financial performance. This timely analysis is critical for assessing how the latest global discussions on climate change are influencing corporate communication strategies on sustainability, offering fresh insights into the evolving dynamics of ESG engagement in the context of these pivotal international meetings. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the authors embrace a grounded theory approach to gain insights into the ESG and sustainability initiatives presented by companies on social media, with an intensified focus on climate change discourse. Leveraging advanced social media analytics, this study expands its scope by conducting a thorough examination of ESG-related tweets from Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 companies. In addition, the authors explore the relationships between such communication efforts and financial performance, applying an advanced cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) model. This methodological enhancement enables a more sophisticated understanding of how ESG communication on Twitter correlates with, and potentially influences, a firm’s market valuation and financial health, offering invaluable insights into the strategic importance of digital sustainability discourse. Findings: The research findings introduce four novel distinct groups – Unengaged, Catalysts, Cautious and Shapers – based on firms’ proactive or reactive sustainability communication patterns. The results explore the potential impact of COP event locations on tweeting behaviour, proposing that conferences held in different regions, such as Asia versus Europe, may elicit varied reactions from S&P 500 firms. Despite no significant inter-industry differences in tweeting habits, the authors discover a significant link between firms’ financial metrics, specifically CARs, and their categorised communication styles. The results challenge the simplistic view that higher social media engagement leads to positive financial outcomes, suggesting instead that lower financial performance may drive firms to adopt more extreme communication patterns, possibly as a strategic move to enhance corporate legitimacy. Originality/value: This study offers new insights into how companies use social media during significant climate change events, namely, COP events. By classifying firms according to their ESG communication approaches, the results reveal uncharted correlations between how companies communicate on social media, namely, Twitter, and the correlation to financial performance. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Sustainability has transcended beyond a mere slogan in the banking sector and has emerged as a pivotal concept that will steer the trajectory of the industry in the forthcoming years. This research has specifically selected the preeminent banks in India, Europe, and the United States of America. Notably, the ESG score for Indian banks is relatively lower in comparison with the average ESG disclosure score for European and American banks. It is noteworthy that the ESG-Control Group-Variable exhibits an unfavorable association with the operational performance of the firm, as indicated by the ROA metric, while a favorable correlation exists between the Control-Group-Variable and Governance-Group-Variable. Furthermore, the ESG-Control Group-Variable demonstrates an adverse relationship with the ROE metric, while a positive relationship exists between the Control-Group-Variable and Governance-Group-Variable. Overall, the ESG-Group-Variable displays a negative relationship with the financial indicators, indicating that companies expending more on ESG activities face a setback in their financial performance metrics. One plausible justification for this phenomenon is that companies are directing funds from more economically lucrative activities toward ESG initiatives, resulting in short-term profits. Country-level analysis reveals that India is the only region displaying a positive relationship between the ESG-Group-Variable and the financial indicators. This could be attributed to the fact that in India, ESG activities are often a by-product of CSR initiatives. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

The results provide evidence that institutional ownership is positively associated with ESG scores, particularly from firms listed in the U.S. suggesting these investors’ consciousness in ESG investments in shipping stocks. Conversely, family ownership is negatively related to ESG ratings, while public ownership is more financially performance-driven, but not ESG-conscious. Additionally, firms with larger market capitalization tend to achieve higher ESG scores.

The sample size consisted of 44 Australian enterprises selected through a purposive sampling technique for five fiscal years, i.e., 2018 to 2022. The performance and value were measured by return on assets (ROA) and Tobin’s Q, whereas the size of the companies (SIZE) was considered as a moderator and leverage (LEVERAGE) was the control variable. The fixed-effects modelling indicated that ESG did not influence the ROA but had an adverse effect on Tobin’s Q. However, while the moderation of the ESG metric by SIZE provided the same results, the individual ESG metrics had a positive impact on the value (Whelan et al., 2021). Practically, the ESG plays a crucial role in influencing the market value of the companies but overdoing might not create a positive mindset in the market, and the share prices might decline. © 2024 The Author.},

To assess the efficiency and quality of corporate sustainability, general (ESG Disclosure Index) and partial (Environmental Disclosure Index, Social Disclosure Index, and Corporate Governance Disclosure Index) indices were used, calculated based on content analysis of sustainability reports. Based on the two given types of indices and four types of financial performance indicators (return on assets, return on equity, assets turnover ratio, and Tobin’s Q), two types of regression models (GEN models and PART models) were built, and eight analytical models were examined. Company size and leverage were included as control variables in each model. The regression analysis results were contradictory, partially confirming the conclusions of some scientists and refuting the findings of others. A study of GEN models revealed that companies implementing more effective general corporate sustainability practices have a significant positive impact only on return on equity; as for other measures (return on assets, assets turnover ratio, and Tobin’s Q), an insignificant relationship between them and ESG Disclosure Index was found. Results of the PART models analysis revealed a significant positive effect of the Social Disclosure Index on return on equity and assets turnover ratio and a negative relationship between the Corporate Governance Disclosure Index and assets turnover ratio.

In this research, the sample of NIFTY50 firms for the period of 2015–2022 was studied. The research is based on panel data regression analysis applied with a fixed effect model, as it was found suitable as compared to pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) and random effect models with the help of the Hausman test. We observed that ESG was found insignificant with ROA in Model 1, environmental pillar score (EPS) in Model 2, and social pillar score (SPS) in Model 3 along with governance pillar score (GPS) in Model 4 while in the case of ROE as a dependent variable, Model 1 ESG was found negatively significant with ROE, EPS in Model 2 and SPS in Model 3 failed to be statistically significant with dependent variable ROE but lastly in Model 4 GPS found negatively significant with ROE. The finding of this study is specific in relation to the data set used and further research outcomes may be traceable through different industries, the outcome of the study will be useful for corporations, policymakers and other stakeholders having financial and non-financial interests. © 2024 The Authors.},

Supporting our hypotheses, we find that spells of extreme high temperature have a curvilinear impact on financial performance. While extreme high temperature spells tend to degrade financial performance in regions or months with normally hotter conditions, the opposite effect is observed for extreme high temperature spells in regions or months with normally cooler conditions. Given our environmental context, where the standard temperature is about 16°C, high temperature spells with maximums that well exceed that temperature have marked financial implications. We also find that spells in locations with maximum temperatures above 23°C associate with smaller improvements in ESG scores and higher carbon emissions in the future, suggesting that managers’ actions to mitigate the risks of high temperature spells are limited at best. Our evidence of significant impacts of extreme temperature on firm performance but little action in response supports the view that managers need more guidance on how to measure the risks and opportunities of extreme weather events and the policies to manage them. © 2024 The Authors},

We also investigate whether it is essential to have a critical mass of women directors on the board to create a significant power of gender diversity in leadership positions. Design/methodology/approach: Our study is based on firms listed on the London Stock Exchange (FTSE-All-Share) from 2011 to 2019. CEO characteristics and other board variables were collected from BoardEx, and ESG data, and other related variables were collected from Eikon database. Findings: We find a critical mass of female directors contributes to ESG performance suggesting that token representation of female directors on boards limits their effectiveness. We do not find support for the gender homophily perspective, our findings suggest that the effectiveness of female CEOs does not depend on the existence of a critical mass of female directors. Female directors and female CEOs are less likely to be associated with ESG activities when firms experience poor financial performance. We also find that younger female CEOs have a positive impact on ESG performance. Furthermore, we find female CEOs with shorter tenure are more likely to improve ESG performance. Overall, our findings suggest a substitutional effect between having female CEOs and gender diverse boards. Originality/value: This study contributes to the debate on gender homophily in the boardroom and how that may affect ESG practices. It also complements existing academic research on female leadership and ESG performance and has important implications for senior management and policymakers. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, these drivers were commonly perceived as following parallel trajectories, neglecting their hierarchical progression nature and leading to misinterpretation when identifying their internal influencing mechanisms. Therefore, this paper employed a three-layer hierarchical linear models (3 L-HLM) on a sample comprising 6139 listed companies worldwide to investigate the factors influencing a firm's CSP outcomes from the external context and internal strength perspectives. Our findings reveal that country-level sustainability performance and corporate financial performance (CFP) positively impact CSP, while sector-level pollution degree negatively affects CSP. Furthermore, country-level and sector-level sustainability indirectly promote CSP by moderating the CFP-CSP relationship, highlighting the context-dependent nature of the improvement effect driven by CFP.

	abstract = {Background: Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors have become topical in recent years because of climate change existential threat to humanity. There is, however, a limited understanding of how the firm’s ESG efforts affect firm outcomes. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between firm’s ESG indicators and the financial performance. Setting: The sample is drawn from Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) listed companies based on data availability. South Africa is not only plagued by social ills and governance failures, but it is also one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases, making it an ideal laboratory for studying the ESG and firm performance nexus. Method: We utilized a dataset spanning the years 2012–2022, covering 67 JSE-listed firms. These panel data were analyzed using the two-step system generalised method of moments (GMM). Results: We found that the disaggregated ESG indexes have a positive, albeit insignificant impact on the financial performance. These findings hold even when financial and non-financial firms are examined separately. Conclusion: Policymakers, including standard setters and regulators, should encourage firms to be sincere on ESG efforts and avoid greenwashing. Contribution: The study employs a relatively robust estimation technique (two-step system GMM) over a relatively long period (2012–2012). Furthermore, the sectoral analysis of financial and non-financial firms adds to the body of literature and policy development. © 2024. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.},

The authors analyse the impact of different elements of social initiatives on wealth creation for firms in terms of operating and market performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on the social initiative scores of over 4,500 firms collected from Thomson Reuters' ESG database. The study uses two-stage least squares (2SLS) to analyse the relationship between social initiatives and firm performance. Findings: Profitable, mature, capital intensive and firms with high sales growth rate tend to invest more in social initiatives. Firms with high agency costs invest in social initiatives for workforce efficiency, maintaining human rights and product responsibility. The study documents evidence that social investments are value creating mechanism for firms which leads to improved financial performance in terms of operating and stock market performance. Firms with high dividend intensity invest in social initiatives for workforce welfare and human rights initiatives. Investment in employee well-being and community initiatives results in intangible benefits such as improved stock market valuation. Practical implications: The research model has not considered the impact of intervening variables to understand the relationship between corporate social performance and corporate financial performance. Social implications: Firms ought to recognize that social investment is beneficial in terms of value creation of firms as stock market perceive such investments favourably. Firms must focus more on community development initiatives and workforce initiatives for the value creation of firms compared to investments directed towards human rights initiatives and product responsibility initiatives. Originality/value: This study focusses exclusively on the social dimension of the CSR activities. The authors examine the impact of social welfare scores on firm performance by analysing the valuation effects on scores representing workforce, human rights, community and product responsibility. Moreover, the paper also examines the impact of a new dimension of product responsibility on firm performance. They also focus on both aspects of financial performance in terms of operating performance (proxied by ROE) and the joint impact of both operating and market performance (proxied by Tobin’s Q).

The investigation was done to check the influence of sustainability disclosures on the cost of debt, including environmental and social dimensions. Additionally, it synthesized perspectives from lending institutions, corporate governance, earnings management, sustainable business practices, and GHG / Carbon emissions in this relationship. The study has also synthesized the literature with conclusion that high-quality environmental and social disclosures with sustainable practices and reduced carbon emission significantly reduce a firm's cost of debt by minimizing perceived risks, and enhancing reputation, credibility and demand from socially responsible investors. Active engagement in CSR, sustainable practices, proper governance, and stakeholder orientation further contribute to lower the cost of debt. Conversely, inadequate disclosure quality, high carbon emissions, poor environmental records and negative media attention may increase borrowing costs and environmental penalties. This study will help CFOs to develop tailored sustainability strategies in optimization of their cost of debt resulting in higher financial performance.

We focused on the energy sector, a significant environmental contributor, and the research spanned from 2016 to 2022, analyzing a broad global sample of 373 firms from 53 countries. ECO was evaluated by integrating environmental scores and conventional financial metrics using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The findings revealed a significant positive relationship between the collective indicator of diversity, inclusion, people development, and the absence of labor incidents on ECO. Specifically, practices related to workforce diversity, cultural and gender implementation, and investments in employee training and development opportunities were found to be beneficial for ECO. Additionally, we found that these policies impact the environmental component of ECO. However, no significant relationship was observed between practices related to inclusion policies and controversial labors, and ECO. Furthermore, the results suggested that ECO within the energy sector is influenced by factors such as board size, the integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects into executive remuneration, the adoption of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy, alignment with the United Nations (UN) Environmental Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the implementation of quality management systems. Conversely, CEO-chairman duality and the presence of independent board members do not significantly impact ECO in energy companies. These research findings provide valuable insights and recommendations for industry managers pursuing sustainable business practices, particularly through effective talent management strategies. Additionally, they offer guidance for investors interested in constructing environmentally conscious portfolios. © 2024 the Author(s).},

Some companies use their audit firm to assure ESG reports, while others seek assurance services from a different firm. This paper investigates the influence of boardroom-based factors – female directors and multiple directorships – on companies' choice of ESG assurance provider. Using a sample of 438 Australian company-year observations from 2010 to 2020 we find that companies with more female directors and busy boards (i.e., boards with directors having at least three concurrent directorships) are more likely to choose a Big-4 audit firm different from their incumbent financial auditor to assure their ESG reports. Based on agency, social capital and resource dependence theories, we explain this ESG assurance procurement strategy as deliberate to address the potential ethical dilemma of engaging the same audit firm for assurance of financial and non-financial information. Our findings suggest that companies with more female directors and busy boards are likelier than their counterparts to apply this ethical stance in choosing their financial auditors and ESG assurers. Implications for policymakers and regulators in designing board diversity guidelines or rules and companies in setting board diversity criteria and policies are discussed. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study examines the relationship between board gender diversity (BGD) and financial performance (FP) in the Malaysian emerging market, focusing on the mediating role of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using a dataset of 976 observations from Malaysian publicly listed companies from 2016 to 2023, this study explores BGD as the independent variable with FP measured through both accounting and market metrics. ESG performance serves as a mediating variable. The analysis employs Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) to examine direct and mediating effects, supplemented by the Baron and Kenny approach and Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regression for robustness. Findings: The findings indicate that higher BGD positively and significantly impacts all three performance measures: Tobin's Q (TQ), Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE). ESG performance positively influences these measures. The SEM analysis reveals a significant positive impact of BGD on ESG performance, which fully mediates the relationship between BGD and TQ/ROA and partially mediates the relationship between BGD and ROE. Practical implications: The results have significant implications for policymakers, board members, scholars and investors, stressing the importance of gender diversity and ESG performance in improving FP. The findings suggest that enhancing board effectiveness through BGD can promote sustainable practices and align corporate strategies with broader sustainability goals, which eventually helps to improve companies’ FP. Originality/value: This research contributes to the literature by highlighting the mediating role of ESG performance in the relationship between BGD and FP and emphasizing the importance of gender diversity in corporate sustainability. It addresses this gap by providing insights into how ESG performance enhances the impact of BGD on FP. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In the era of Industry 5.0, understanding the balance between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and firm performance is crucial for mitigating climate change and enhancing financial outcomes. This paper aims to analyze the effect of ESG disclosure on the financial performance (FP) of renewable and clean energy (RCE) companies, focusing on the combined ESG disclosure and individual E, S, and G disclosure scores. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyzed a panel data sample from 2015–2021, covering 41 RCE companies. By applying the K-means++ clustering technique, the research also explored how firm-specific features influence the relationship between ESG disclosure and FP. The Bloomberg database and audited financial reports were used to gather the data for the study. Findings: The findings indicate that increased ESG disclosure positively influences FP. Further, a significant positive relationship exists between FP and a company’s E and S disclosure. However, firm-specific characteristics significantly influence this relationship. Findings suggest that a company’s commitment to comprehensive ESG efforts enhances financial efficiency rather than increasing costs. Originality/value: This study adds to the ESG-FP literature by emphasizing global RCE companies, a key player in sustainability. Further, to the best of the author’s knowledge, the study’s uniqueness is attributed to its application of a two-step approach, combining ESG-FP analysis with K-means++ clustering to account for firm-specific characteristics. It also uniquely examines the individual impact of E, S, and G disclosure on the FP of global RCE companies. The findings offer valuable insights for businesses and policymakers in developing strategies that improve profitability while addressing climate change risks. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Research Question/Issue: This paper examines whether the coverage of nonfinancial rating (NFR) agencies affects corporate dividend policy. Research Findings/Insights: We argue that dividend payout may decrease (increase) if NFR agencies provide information that reduces (increases) shareholder–manager agency (shareholder–stakeholder) conflict. We find that the coverage by an NFR agency is followed by an increase in dividends. This result is more pronounced for firms with more influential shareholders, poorer financial performance, and greater ESG commitment. We corroborate our findings using the acquisitions of NFR agencies and the expansion of NFR agencies' coverage as two main exogenous shocks. Lastly, our results hold for both US firms and non-US firms. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Collectively, this paper supports that the ESG ratings made available by NFR rating agencies following their rating coverage increase shareholder–stakeholder conflict to a greater extent than its effect on reducing shareholder–managers agency conflict. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our paper delivers critical insights to regulators striving to comprehend the functions of NFR agencies within the capital market more effectively. Such an understanding can further support their efforts to formulate new guidelines suitable for the burgeoning and swiftly evolving industry of NFR agencies. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

The results show that ESG disclosure have a positive impact on permanent tax differences, which are produced by philanthropic, among others. However, the effect of ESG disclosure on temporary differences, which can be related to tax avoidance practices, is negative. Companies committed to ESG do not engage in tax avoidance. Regarding the moderating effect of financial indicators, the results show that only profitability positively moderates the relationship between ESG disclosure and temporary tax differences. ESG disclosure could be used to hide tax avoidance practices. The findings have important implications for policymakers, supporting the creation of effective regulations that incorporate companies' tax practices into the ESG objectives.

	abstract = {In the new stage of economic development, ESG is an important concept of enterprise operation under the guidance of sustainable development. Under the guidance of green development, how to embed the multiple responsibilities of enterprise environment, society and corporate governance (ESG) into the enterprise innovation system and drive the transformation of traditional innovation to green innovation and green development has become the focus of academic attention. In recent years, the academic circles have increasingly enriched the relevant research around ESG. The existing research mainly focuses on the value effect of ESG, but there is still a gap in the relevant research on the value effect of enterprise ESG performance, which mainly focuses on the enterprise economic performance, but pays less attention to the enterprises green technology innovation, and the research on non-economic performance is still weak. In essence, enterprise green technology innovation is an important type of enterprise sustainable innovation, which is different from general financial performance and has multiple attributes of economic performance and social environmental performance. And from the perspective of the driving factors of enterprise green technology innovation, the existing research mainly discusses the specific impact of environmental regulation on enterprise green technology innovation from the policy perspective, but enterprise green technology innovation is not only closely related to environmental regulation, but also closely related to the enterprise′ s sustainable development orientation and strategic emphasis. Therefore, under the guidance of sustainable development, a systematic discussion of the impact of enterprise ESG performance and its various dimensions on enterprise green technology innovation will help make up for the lack of the “ESG-CFP” research framework, and re-examine the green sustainable endogenous driving effect of enterprise ESG performance in the process of enterprise technology innovation. Based on the above research gaps, this paper takes China′s A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2019 as the empirical research sample, empirically analyzes the actual impact of enterprise ESG performance on enterprise green technology innovation and its internal mechanism, and examines the specific impact of corporate environmental responsibility, social responsibility and corporate governance performance on enterprise green technology innovation from a multi-dimensional perspective. It further analyzes the moderating effect of external environmental regulation and internal executive incentive on the relationship between enterprise ESG performance and enterprise green technology innovation. The research contributions of this paper are as follows: First, based on large sample data, this paper comprehensively investigated the specific effects and mechanisms of ESG performance on enterprise green technology innovation, which helps to open the theoretical black box of ESG performance driving enterprise green technology innovation at the theoretical level, clarify the internal mechanism of ESG performance for enterprise green technology innovation, and provide a new research perspective on how to drive enterprise green technology innovation. At the same time, this study also enriches the measurement methods of existing research on enterprise green technology innovation and avoids the deviation of estimation results caused by too narrow sample selection. Secondly, this study enriches the research on the value effect of ESG performance and expands the traditional research framework of “ESG-CFP”. The existing research mainly focuses on the impact of ESG performance on the financial or economic performance of enterprises, ignoring the green innovation (GI) of enterprises with dual value orientation. This paper reshapes the value effect of ESG performance based on the value transmission framework of “ESG-GI”. Thirdly, this study enriches the boundary conditions of the influencing factors of green technology innovation based on the internal and external combination of external environmental regulation and internal strategic decision-maker incentive, and provides a new perspective framework for re-examining the regulatory environment and incentive intensity of enterprise green technology innovation. Finally, this study provides the basic framework guidance for the government and micro enterprises to further strengthen the policy and management system construction of enterprise green technology innovation at the practical level, which is helpful for enterprises to strengthen the green innovation orientation and ultimately achieve innovation drive and innovation leadership at the stage of high-quality economic development. The results of this study show that, firstly, enterprises ESG performance and its dimensions have a significant positive effect on green technology innovation. Secondly, enterprises ESG performance mainly promotes enterprise green technology innovation by strengthening enterprise environmental protection investment, easing enterprise financing constraints and improving enterprise internal control quality. Thirdly, external environmental regulations (environmental protection subsidies and pollution charges) and internal executive incentives (salary incentives and equity incentives) have a significant positive moderating effect between enterprises ESG performance and enterprises green technology innovation. Fourth, the driving effect of enterprise ESG performance on enterprise green technology innovation is more obvious in state-owned enterprises, enterprises that have passed the international ISO14001 environmental certification and manufacturing enterprises. And the economic effect test results show that enterprise ESG performance driven enterprise green technology innovation can help improve enterprise economic performance. The research of this paper has three implications for the government and enterprises. For the government, first, strengthen the concept of green development and innovation driven development of enterprises, unswervingly promote the construction of enterprise green technology innovation system, better encourage enterprises to carry out green technology innovation through a series of institutional arrangements and policy optimization, and provide a sound external policy environment for enterprises to carry out green technology innovation and optimize enterprise green technology innovation management system. Second, the government needs to continue to optimize the construction of the ESG system in the capital market, and better play the policy optimization effect on the ESG performance of listed companies by combining the inductive system with the mandatory system. Third, governments need to strengthen coordination and linkage, strengthen the construction of internal coordination system between governments in the process of promoting enterprises green technology innovation, realize the combination effect of different policies oriented to enterprises green technology innovation, and better promote the high-quality development of enterprises green technology innovation. For enterprises, first, attach great importance to the strategic value of enterprises ESG performance from the strategic level, integrate ESG ideas into the enterprise strategic decision-making, stakeholder management mechanism and corporate governance process, promote ESG ideas to be better embedded in the enterprise′ s technological innovation process and business model innovation, and create shared values and comprehensive values covering the economy, society and environment. Second, enterprises need to continue to strengthen the construction of green technology innovation system. On the one hand, they should continue to optimize the investment structure of green technology innovation, better arrange the investment funds for environmental protection and choose innovation methods; On the other hand, they need to optimize the executive incentive system arrangement under the ESG concept to provide the institutional basis for corporate executives to attach importance to green technology innovation and environmental responsibility orientation. Third, enterprises need to build a sustainable development oriented ESG performance disclosure system, better communicate the enterprise′s sustainable concept and relevant sustainable practice progress to investors and other social stakeholders through ESG performance disclosure, obtain external stakeholders′ capital support and social support for enterprise green technology innovation, and ultimately provide sustainable impetus for enterprises to carry out green technology innovation. © (2024), (Zhejiang University).

The proposed CSR Index integrates 17 CSR components based on the ISO 26000 standard, as an alternative empirical index of the CSR impact on shipping company financial performance and value. The empirical results support the hypothesis of a significant positive correlation between CSR and shipping corporate performance and value and underline the preference of investors for shipping companies with established good CSR practices. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Findings: The essay concludes that the relevance of ESG is broader than what is currently perceived. The piece endorses a view to look at ESG from other perspectives and benefits, not only from its financial relevance. It should be understood and implemented at the grassroots level.

Within this landscape falls the present study that aimed to examine the quality of ESG reporting connected to the financial performance of listed companies. Stratified analysis revealed four groups of companies according to the average value of ROA and ROE indicators, as well as four classes according to the average ESG disclosure score. The analysis of GRI topics and materiality disclosure scores showed an average disclosure level on ESG components, located between a satisfactory and a good level of disclosure. Also, companies were found to be more inclined to disclose data on the sustainability strategy but provided poor and vague information on the business model. The results of comparative clustering analysis based on FinESG reporting and disclosure scores showed that 31.57% of companies maintained their position in the final ranking. Content analysis of sustainability reports by Leximancer, v.5.0 software highlighted that the most salient topic was “employees”, and it revealed correlations between the themes “employees” and “emissions”. The practical implications of the study were found in the promotion of an integrated reporting that best meets the needs of both stakeholders and those of environmental protection and the development of society. © 2023 by the authors.},

The two research objectives were: (1) to identify and analyze the key factors of sustainable competitiveness at company level (2) to find sector-related discrepancies regarding the identified factors. To achieve them, a horizontal analysis covering ten financial years (2012–2021) was performed on a sample of 1,449 companies from four global economic sectors (Consumer Cyclicals, Energy, Health Care, and Technology) – using Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and ANOVA. Nine factors (both financial and non-financial) were found: liquidity, profitability, revenue efficiency, inventory management efficiency, ESG performance, receivables management efficiency, R&D efficiency, book value, and market value. Of them, ESG performance has emerged as an inde-pendent factor based on non-financial variables, its introduction into the research model being one of the study’s novelties. Significant mean differences were found between the nine factors, depending on the sector, which allowed the ranking of sectors in terms of sustainable competitiveness, in descending order: Health Care, Technology, Consumer Cyclicals, and Energy. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {As the demand for investment products tied to environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns rises, ESG stock indices have been established. These indices aim to aid investors in navigating and assessing the risks associated with firms based on ESG factors and potential investment returns. The objective of the article is to predict ESG stock indices using a machine learning approach. We use daily data of Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) World, DJSI Asia Pacific and DJSI Emerging Market from 2018 to 2022 as samples. Two-layer ensemble model – combination of support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithms – is employed to forecast the indices. The results show that the ensemble model accurately forecasts the indices, with the prediction line closely matching the actual values. It gives the implication that investors are able to improve investment decisions, assist in managing investment risk, and optimize their portfolio diversification. Meanwhile, policymakers are able to anticipate economic trends, inflation and interest rates, assisting in the development of successful economic policies. This research article presents a machine learning approach for predicting ESG stock indices. The proposed model combines SVM, RF, LSTM and GRU algorithms to create a powerful two-layer ensemble model that outperforms individual models. The results show that the ensemble model accurately forecasts ESG stock indices, with the prediction line closely matching the actual values. The model offers insights into the behaviour of different algorithms, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The proposed model can guide decision-making processes, support investment strategies, and ultimately contribute to advancing sustainable investment practices. © 2024 International Management Institute, New Delhi.},

Now, as the European Banking Authority has acknowledged that ESG risks can potentially impact the economic and financial system, the debate on systemic risk has gained traction. Understanding the relationship between ESG merit and systemic risk is of utmost importance for the stability of the economic and financial system, still, research is limited. Relying on real-world European and United Stated data, we quantify systemic risk by means of QL-CoVaR. Empirical analyses of the entire period from 2007 to 2021 show that companies with high ESG scores tend to exhibit low QL-CoVaR values indicating a positive effect of ESG scores. Such evidence is confirmed by clustering the individual companies into ESG portfolios and focusing on COVID-19. Additional insights using the individual pillars are also provided. © 2022 The Authors.

We explore changes in an acquirer’s ESG rating around merger and acquisition (M&A) announcements and provide empirical evidence of a positive relationship between the change in an acquirer’s ESG rating and the target’s relative ESG rating. Of the three components of an ESG rating, an acquirer’s environmental rating displays the largest increase, with social and governance ratings exhibiting a smaller but still significant post-merger increase. This relationship is weaker for cross-border deals or cross-industry deals. However, deals that are both cross-border and same-industry are associated with a larger increase in an acquirer’s ESG rating. In addition to improved ESG ratings, the acquisition of a firm with a superior ESG rating is also associated with higher bid premiums and improved post-merger financial performance which suggests that acquirers act in shareholders’ best interests.

Whereas the ultimate goal of ESG responsibilities is non-financial matters, that is, to incorporate socially acceptable norms into business activities to reach sustainable goals for society. Employing an unbalance panel data model for listed companies in Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2016 to 2022, this study provides empirical evidence on the indirect impact of ESG implementation on firms’ non-financial performance. Consistent with the stakeholder theory, this study found a positive impact of ESG implementation on firm values. The predictability of ESG performance in future financial performance is in line with the resource-based views. ESG-related financial performance has a positive impact on non-financial performance. Firms are willing to increase their commitment to ESG activities if these activities can primarily improve their financial performance. The regulatory policy with dual materiality characteristic is effective in mitigating the mere financial motives of ESG implementation to the more substantive outcomes on ESG-related issues. The effective law enforcement is able to encourage the companies not only to symbolically implement the ESG but to go beyond the legitimate substantive strategic implementation. © 2024 The Author(s).

Using financial data on publicly traded firms in Indonesia, this study aims to explore the interplay between the cost of capital, firm performance and the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses firm-level data sets of publicly listed firms from 2012 to 2021. The regression analysis reported in the study includes the Driscoll–Kraay estimator, propensity score matching model and fixed-effects regression. Findings: The study revealed three significant findings. First, on average, non-environmental, social and governance (ESG) companies’ cost of capital is lower than that of ESG firms. Second, ROE in ESG enterprises is significantly impacted by capital costs. Third, the cost of capital has a negative impact on the market value (Tobin’s q) of non-ESG firms. The study specifically shows that after accounting for the pandemic, ESG firms did not benefit during the troubled COVID-19 crisis after controlling for the pandemic dummy years of 2020 and 2021. These results indicate that the adoption of green or sustainable finance is still in its infancy and that the sector requires more time to establish an enabling environment. Research limitations/implications: This study benefits from capital structure and ESG theories. It supports the argument that the debt utilization ratio is still relevant to a company’s value because it affects its financial performance. Moreover, adopting ESG principles helps businesses survive crises. Thus, the analysis confirms the superiority of ESG-based firms. Practical implications: This study draws two conclusions. First, the results could be a reference for academics and practitioners to understand the effect of pandemic-related crises on a firm’s capital structure and performance. In terms of survival during a crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, this study demonstrates how firms with strong ESG may perform differently than those without ESG. Second, this study supports the need for an empirical study and examination of the development of sustainable finance in the country while considering setbacks. Social implications: The results should be of interest to policymakers who focus on the ESG market and academics conducting ESG-related research on emerging markets. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by establishing empirical evidence on the relationship between the cost of capital and firm performance of ESG- and non-ESG-rated enterprises in the Indonesian setting while controlling for the impact of the pandemic. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We specifically examine the impact of structural (board independence) and demographical (age, gender, education, tenure and industry experience) board diversity on firm performance. Drawing on the agency and resource base perspective, the results indicate that firms with a diverse board of directors (structural and demographic) perform significantly better with firm performance. Additionally, when viewed through the lens of stakeholder theory, the findings indicate that environmental, social and governance disclosure (ESG) moderates and partially mediates the relationship between the diverse board of directors and firm performance. We also performed robust checks to validate our results. Diversity contributes to a firm's understanding of its market and, as a result, its overall performance. The current study demonstrates a considerable gap between the theoretical and empirical support for various board indicators (structural and demographic), their relationship to performance, and how ESG acts as an intervening element in increasing firm financial performance. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Research Question/Issue: We contrast the predictions of gender socialization theory and “fem-power washing” (deceptively positioning as a firm promoting female empowerment without any tangible actions) to investigate whether promoting female directors on the board of directors associates with a reduction in the prevalence of firm-level workplace sexual harassment (SH). Research Findings/Insights: We estimate the incidence rate of SH through textual analysis of US employees' job reviews published online during the period 2011–2021. We find that an increase of one female director is associated with a 21.81% decrease in workplace SH and that firms with high board gender diversity synchronize the reduction in SH with improved social policies (e.g., policies to better employee relations, health and safety, or diversity challenges). Our results do not support the fem-power washing theory but rather imply that nominating female directors may have a profound impact on the firm's ethical culture. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study validates the ethical dimension of corporate governance: Nominating female directors impacts a firm harassment culture and, by extension, a firm's ethical and corporate culture. This study adds to the governance literature that debates the merits of board gender diversity by highlighting an oft-ignored channel through which board diversity affects firm value: ethics and corporate culture. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For boards of directors, having more female directors can curb workplace SH, a behavior that is associated with a severe and lasting negative effect on firm value. For practitioners, regulators, and the business community, this study reinforces the merits of aiming towards more gender-balanced boards. © 2022 The Authors.

For this purpose, the models of choice were panel data considering ten years. A set of independent control variables and ESG score or subsets of the ESG score were investigated against the dependent measures of a firm’s financial (ROA) and market-based (Tobin’s Q) performance. The paper's novelty is the industry-specific perspective and results that are scarce and indicate a mixed influence of the ESG subsets. The results obtained by regression analysis underline a non-significant positive relationship between ESG and ROA, meaning ESG activities are valued less than expected. Interestingly, the market's valuation, which Tobin's Q should capture, has presented some significant influence. That implies that investors value ESG performance in the long term, which is particularly relevant information for decision-makers in the automotive industry. © 2023, Czestochowa University of Technology.

In this vein, this study is the first to utilize multiple CEO characteristics as a moderating role influencing the association between corporate sustainability and financial performance. In addition, the study focuses on the developing country of Saudi Arabia, which is one of the top oil producers in the world and is targeting to invest billions of dollars in renewable and sustainable energy projects according to Saudi Vision 2030. We primarily focused on ESG activities (environmental, social, and governance) and their impact on the return on assets and return on equity (employed as a proxy of financial performance). This study used the ordinary least squares (OLS) model to examine these associations as well as the system GMM to test for endogeneity problems. Using a sample of 1143 observations to represent the non-financial firms listed on the Tadawul All Share Index (TASI) for 9 years from 2014 to 2022, we found a negative and significant relationship between the activities of corporate sustainability and financial performance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CEO characteristics (CEO busyness, CEO ownership, CEO education, CEO gender, and CEO tenure) exerted influence on the association between corporate sustainability and financial performance; that is, CEO busyness, CEO ownership, and CEO gender mitigated the negative influence of corporate sustainability on financial performance, whereas CEO education and CEO tenure made it worse.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between sustainability and financial performance in a geographical context that has not been studied. Specifically, this study examines the relationship of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance to the financial performance of Indonesian banking companies during the period 2010–20. As a methodology, we used panel data (ESG data from Thomson Reuters), statistical correlations, and regression models. Financial performance was measured by Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Tobin’s Q (TQ). The findings show that ESG is negatively related to all dependent variables (ROA, ROE, and TQ), but each ESG pillar (environmental, social, and governance) yields different results. The social pillar has a significant positive effect on ROA and ROE, governance has a significant negative effect on TQ, and business environment has no significant impact on financial performance. As to the study’s limitations/implications, the findings advance decision makers’ understanding of the quality of organizations’ contributions to improving ESG reporting in financial reporting. The study’s findings on the relationship between ESG reporting and banks’ financial performance also have implications for stakeholders, ESG policymakers, academics, and assurance providers. While the specific research gap addressed is the relationship between ESG and financial performance in Indonesian banking companies, other interesting issues are the voluntary vs. mandatory nature of these reports and the impact of each modality on the variables considered. © 2023 by the authors.},

Firms are purposely selected based on pre-established criteria of financial and sustainability performance. Through a reiterative process, research is untangled in three stages of interactions with participants for a total of six societal objectives and 34 projects. Primary data are collected from heads of departments or sustainability project managers through semi-structured interviews, surveys, and email exchanges between 2018 and 2021. This paper provides theoretical and practical contributions. In particular, this research extends the theoretical discussions about how to reconcile business and societal interests by adopting a new perspective to organisational decisions based on the assessment of change effects.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this article is to explore the phenomena of board gender diversity and its consequences for sustainability performance, as measured by the environment, social and governance (ESG) disclosure score, in the Indian context. Design/methodology/approach: The positivist paradigm influenced the research design for this study. The relationship between firm's ESG performance and female participation on the corporate boards was explored using panel data regression with a fixed effect approach. A total of 712 data points covering the Nifty 100 companies of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) were included in the data set. To add robustness to the findings and to overcome endogeneity bias, authors employed the Dynamic Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Findings: The results showed that, a relatively small, percentage of women directors has little impact on ESG performance, but when at least three women directors are in place, these relationships become more favourable. Despite the fact that Indian firms trail behind many developed and developing countries in promoting board gender equality, authors conclude that critical mass theory partially applies in the Indian context. Originality/value: This study contributes to the field of corporate governance in the twenty-first century by investigating the subject of women's participation on boards in the context of a rising market and its potential influence on sustainability performance. The use of critical mass theory adds a fresh perspective to the literature. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The impact of board gender diversity on firm value is inconclusive. The paper investigates whether a firm’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance mediates the relationship between board gender diversity and firm financial performance. The study employs a sample of 1514 non-financial firms listed on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) and New York Stock Exchanges (NYSE) from 2016 to 2020. It reveals that a firm improves its ESG ratings and financial performance when there are more female directors on its board. When controlling ESG performance, the significant relationship between board gender diversity and firm performance turns insignificant, and ESG performance has a significant positive impact on a firm’s financial performance. These findings confirm the mediating role of ESG performance in the studied relationship. A firm’s management can refer to these findings to employ more women on its board, which creates additional firm financial value through better ESG practices. Investors may incorporate the factors of board gender diversity and corporate ESG performance into their investment decisions. © 2023 Conscientia Beam. All Rights Reserved.},

Purpose: The essential aim of this paper is to explain the differentiation of business efficiency in terms of corporate sustainability performance by answering the question of how sustainability pillar scores influence the relative efficiency of a company? Research methodology: The empirical studies were conducted among the 20 top companies listed on the WSE for the period of 2019-2021 with the use of the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results: The research hypothesis, which states that more efficient companies are characterized by a higher level of sustainability in all its particular dimensions, cannot be positively verified, because a positive and statistically significant correlation dependence between the average efficiency measure and average sustainability pillar scores existed only for the governance dimension. Novelty: The estimation of efficiency measure based on corporate sustainability performance has included not only environmental, social and governance dimensions, but also the economic one, which was represented by the long-term returns pillar score. © 2023 Agnieszka Matuszewska-Pierzynka, published by Sciendo.},

To achieve the study objectives, 114 companies listed on Indonesian Stock Exchange market are selected covering the data span over 2013-2020 period. Institutional ownership, female directors, ESG performance, return on assets and firm size are taken as the measures of ownership structure, composition of company directors, ESG and financial performance respectively. Empirical analysis is carried out using Fixed Effects Model as it is found as the appropriate estimation technique in Hausman test and Breusch-Pagan test. According to the study findings, EGS, ownership structure, composition of company directors all have significant and negative impact on tax avoidance. Among financial performance indicators, only firm size has negative and significant impact while return on assets has no significant effect on tax avoidance. The study recommends the firms or businesses to pay attention to ESG factors, institutional ownership and female directorship as these factors are found to have prominent role in improving tax avoidance behavior. © 2023, Econjournals.

The purpose of this paper is to study the relationship between ESG scores and financial performance of firms operating in emerging markets, in particular BRICS countries. This study includes three financial performance indicators to cover three different perspectives: accounting measure (ROA), market performance (TSR) and economic metric (EVA spread). The ESG scores, its pillars and other financial metrics are taken from Refinitiv Eikon. The sample consists of 257 listed companies operating in BRICS countries throughout 2017–2021. The main method of the research is the Fixed Effect method for panel data. The results showed that there is no statistical significance between ESG and ROA. Besides, govern-ment pillars negatively affect ROA through CSR that is explained by legitimacy theory. As for TSR, ESG, social and environment pillars have positive effects on market performance measure, following stakeholder theory. Regarding economic performance, ESG and social pillar have negative influence on EVA spread. © 2023, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics. All rights reserved.},

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unexpected difficulties in the operations of most companies, leading to a significant deterioration in their financial performance. We use empirical analysis to examine whether a company's ESG activities affect its financial performance. We employ the context-dependent data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to evaluate the performance and provide a benchmark-learning roadmap for 27 photoelectric companies in Taiwan. We also compare the marketability, innovation ability, and profitability of three sub-industries: camera modules, optical component lenses, and optical components. Furthermore, we utilize a combination of classical DEA, stratification DEA, measurement of attractiveness, and progress for company evaluation. The results indicate that validating sustainability reports has a positive information effect, and high-quality Global Reporting Initiative-based external third-party confirmed reports possess relatively high credibility, readability, and information value. The content and quality of these reports have an impact on performance. These findings offer insights into the role of ESG activities in the photoelectric industry and can help managers reflect upon and justify their choice to invest in specific ESG activities.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the direct relationship between board gender diversity (BGD) and financial performance and the moderating role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the said relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Using data collected from the Thomson Reuters Eikon ASSET4 database from 42 UK financial institutions listed in the ESG index for the period 2005–2019, this study used multivariate regression analysis on panel data to test the effect of BGD on financial performance and estimate the moderating effect of CSR between them. Moreover, to control the endogeneity problem, the authors conducted an additional analysis by testing the dynamic dimension of the data set through the generalized moment method. Findings: The empirical results show that BGD is positively related to financial performance and that BGD increases firm performance with the moderating effect of CSR. Regarding the endogeneity problem, the existence of continuity between financial institution performances over time is demonstrated. Research limitations/implications: The current paper sheds light on the importance of BGD in improving firm performance and the moderating role of CSR in strengthening the relationship between BGD and firm performance, thereby contributing to the agency theory, the resource dependency theory and the stakeholder theory. Therefore, regulators and policymakers in the UK can use the outcomes of this study to enforce the representation of female directors on boards to enhance the financial performance of financial institutions. Moreover, the findings could be useful for regulatory bodies to encourage financial institutions to practice CSR activities and disclose them in their annual reports. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study investigating the moderating role of CSR on the relationship between BGD and financial performance in the context of the financial sector. It is also the first study documenting that CSR reinforces the relationship between gender-diverse boards and financial institutions' performance. This study fills a research gap as it expands the existing literature that has generally focused on the impact of BGD on financial performance and has not reached similar results. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment strategies have garnered increasing attention in stock markets worldwide. The number of related funds and their money inflow, for instance, have more than doubled over the past 3 years. Yet, one fundamental question remains unanswered in the specialized literature: has there been any added value and statistical differentiation among ESG strategies in stock markets? We contribute to this discussion by assessing a range of ESG investment strategies across the globe. Daily closing prices of ESG best practices indices are collected for the period between 2011 and 2021, along with proxies for the market portfolio and the risk-free rate. Empirical assessments are then conducted using classic and modern portfolio metrics as well as nonparametric tests. The results indicate a considerable degree of differentiation of the governance factor in every region studied, while the environmental and social agendas have remained considerably intertwined, with their theoretical portfolios showing similar risk–return profiles and high levels of correlation. The relative performance of ESG factors across regions has also varied considerably, with most developed economies prioritizing the environmental and social agenda for investments, and the governance factor providing better risk-adjusted returns in emerging markets and in the Unites States. Implications and an agenda for future research are further discussed. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The actions taken worldwide to combat the effects of climate change have boosted the analysis of related economic risks in the financial sector on the three components: environment, social, and governance (ESG). ESG scores calculated by specialized providers for listed companies are increasingly taken into account, in addition to economic and financial ones, demonstrating the importance of these factors for the financial system. Some studies show that from the investors’ point of view, pursuing ESG objectives positively limits legal and reputational risks, firm performance, and the perception of firms’ risk profiles. These factors help reduce the risk premium and cost of capital, benefiting financial performance. Based on these findings, we considered investigating the reaction of listed European banks’ returns to ESG value changes. The analysis covers the stock prices of all banks traded on stock exchanges from Europe, considering the analysis of daily frequencies between 2010 and 2021. We collected data on the values of ESG components for all these companies and created a database with all moments when changes in these values took place. Further, we run an event study analysis of the impact of these modifications on the dynamics of stock market log returns for the sample of banks. Our objective is to quantify investors’ reactions to these changes and document differences in responses to increased versus decreased values of ESG. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of mutual funds during the COVID-19 pandemic with environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. The main research question is whether mutual fund performance differs with respect to the level of the mutual fund’s ESG score. Design/methodology/approach: The data set contains global fund data, and mutual fund performance is analyzed using two types of data envelopment analysis (DEA) models: the DEA portfolio index (DPEI) and the range direction measure (RDM) DEA. Propensity score matching and logistic regression are also applied. Findings: The results reveal that: nonequity mutual funds present significantly higher performance compared to the performance of equity mutual funds; mutual funds with high ESG scores are associated with significantly higher performance compared to those with low to medium ESG scores; funds with high ESG scores experience higher performance irrespective of their type; and efficiency scores derived from the RDM DEA are significantly higher than those derived from the DPEI model. Research limitations/implications: Investors, fund managers and market participants can benefit from the findings of this study and improve their investment decision-making process, including more sustainable funds in their portfolios. Regulators and policymakers should further promote or even require the inclusion of more sustainable investments in the financial products offered by institutional investors. The main limitation of the study is related to data availability regarding the ESG score of mutual funds. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that provides robust evidence in support of a positive association between ESG scores and mutual fund performance during the pandemic-induced crisis applying a DEA methodology. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To conduct our study, we use annual environmental, social and governance (ESG) data on 407 European firms listed in STOXX Europe 600 Index during the period 2002–2018. Results reveal that the moderating effect of size is positive for environmentally sensitive industries and negative for environmentally non-sensitive industries. We conclude that in environmentally non-sensitive industries, large firms engage in symbolic CSR practices, while smaller ones implement substantive CSR actions. However, in environmentally sensitive industries, in order to meet stakeholders’ requirements, large firms engage in effective CSR initiatives, while smaller ones, being forced to involve in costly CSR practices, would be harmed and lose all interest in CSR implementation. This study has implications for policymakers, investors and corporate managers in various industries for evaluating and controlling the effectiveness of CSR practices and initiatives. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

This study is driven by the motivation to add to the current literature by investigating the mediating elements that explain the relationship between CSR and forward default risk. In this paper, we attempt to identify the important mediators and give a more comprehensive explanation of this connection by a thorough assessment of the available literature and empirical research. This study explored the relationship between corporate social responsibility and forward default risk through financial performance and goodwill. The study sample consisted of constituents of Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 index. It was found from the results of the study that corporate social responsibility has an effect on forward default risk through goodwill and financial performance. The direct and indirect effect of CSR on forward default risk is more enhanced in a 1-year period, as the effect on 3-year forward default risk is lower. Similar results are found during period of economic upswing; however, there is no mediation in CSR and 1-year forward default risk by goodwill. This study has some policy implications. Overall, the study adds to the growing body of literature (stakeholder theory and corporate finance theory) on the relationship between CSR and the financial aspect of firms and highlights the importance of considering CSR in financial decision-making and risk management. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Top management incentives were a mediating mechanism for state-owned equity participation in enhancing ESG performance. This study also found that when state-owned equity participated in large enterprises, or companies with a high degree of digital transformation, the effect on the ESG performance was greater than in small or medium-sized enterprises, or enterprises with a low level of digital transformation.

Motivation: In the context of the growing importance of sustainability reporting, understanding the link between ESG and firm performance is critical for informed and sustainable corporate strategies. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study employs panel data regression techniques on secondary data from 120 Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed firms between 2015 and 2020. Main Findings: Overall, the composite ESG scores do not significantly affect the financial performance of South African companies. However, scores from social and governance pillars show a positive association with firm performance, while environmental scores have a limited effect. Practical Implications/Managerial Impact: These findings suggest that not all ESG activities are equally relevant for firm profitability. Corporate managers should prioritise industry-relevant ESG pillars to enhance firm profitability. Novelty/Contribution: The study expands empirical evidence in an emerging market context, analysing the impact of disaggregated ESG scores and providing comparative industry-specific analysis. This contributes to a nuanced understanding of the ESG-performance nexus. © 2024 South African Journal of Accounting Research.},

	abstract = {At a time when gender equality is a key priority of all international organizations, this paper can be considered a remarkable contribution to the role of women executives in firms’ performance. More specifically, this study focuses on the effect of women holding positions of responsibility on firms’ performance worldwide. For the purposes of our research, we applied cross-sectional and panel data analysis for all sectors at an international level from 2019, the year preceding the breakout of the pandemic crisis, to 2021, while the indicators used to measure the participation of women in executive positions are classified as ESG indices. The empirical analysis findings end up showing that the participation of women in executive positions positively affects firms’ performance over time, while there is no material change observed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic period. More specifically, when the percent of women processing job positions of responsibility increases by 10%, then the index of profitability will increase from 1.4% to 1.8%, regardless of the measurement of female participation in executive positions used. The results of this study constitute a remarkable contribution to the promotion of the creative economy, the progress of societies, and sustainable development. The research’s outcome can be primarily used by policymakers drawing up policies for achieving gender equality in the labor market and workplaces and by shareholders and firms’ managers in order to trust females in executive positions in favor of their firms’ financial performance. The current study is unique in that it focuses on the period before and during the COVID-19 period, as a period of high volatility in economic activity worldwide, while the sample includes firms from large and mid-cap companies belonging to developed and emerging markets. The above approach will contribute to providing more credible information related to the role of women executives in firms’ performance. © 2023 by the authors.},

It utilises a new method for constructing an ESG portfolio with a high exposure towards ESG that eliminates the inherent correlation between size and ESG. In that perspective, a zero initial investment portfolio that goes long in responsible companies and short in irresponsible companies is adopted; hence, developing a ‘Responsible Minus Irresponsible’ (RMI) factor mimicking portfolio. A pricing anomaly test on this portfolio suggests that ESG exerts superior financial performance, mostly as a result of a significant lower market risk. Performing a cross-sectional analysis of different factor models on an international set of company returns indicates a negative effect of ESG on expected returns. However, the ESG factor becomes insignificant once multiple factors are introduced as explanatory variables. Consequently, ESG represents a pricing anomaly but does not act as an independent risk factor. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Using a longitudinal fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on a sample of 185 global listed companies in the utilities sector from 2018 to 2021, we demonstrate that various combinations of sub-dimensions of ESG activities determine the level of financial performance (FP). We use two accounting metrics and two market-based indicators and identify different configurations across time from the perspective of each measure. According to the accounting-based indicators, a good performance on the S pillar and an absence on the E pillar generate high financial outcomes across time, regardless of their performance on the G pillar. However, from the market perspective, both the E and S pillars are determinants for generating high FP, indicating that the three dimensions of ESG do not need to exist simultaneously to lead to high financial outcomes. This research contributes to the understanding of needed improvements to sector and industry-specific analyses focusing on the utilities sector, an environmentally sensitive but scarcely studied sector. The study specifically sheds light on how publicly traded utility companies should strategically combine efforts in the E, S, and G pillars based on whether their focus is on short-term profits or, conversely, long-term profits. Additionally, it expands the application of longitudinal fsQCA to research related to sustainability. © 2023 The Authors},

Assessing the sustainable development performance of power enterprises has become the key to the sustainable financing and development of power enterprises in this new developmental stage. Based on the integration of the long-term UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) evaluation indicators of listed companies, this paper constructed an index system for the evaluation of the sustainable development of electric power companies consisting of 75 indicators corresponding to four dimensions: economic, social, environmental, and governance. Given the vision for the sustainable development of electric power companies, the assessment thresholds for each indicator were determined by the practical exploration and typical progress assessment of SDGs. Aggregate assessment and dashboard assessment techniques for the sustainable development of electric power companies were established, and we conducted a robustness analysis of the evaluation system. The results revealed the following details: (1) The disclosure of sustainable development indicators of Chinese electricity enterprises was 94.13%, among which the four dimensions of economy, environment, society, and governance were 99.89%, 82.62%, 94.00%, and 97.71%, respectively. (2) The aggregate sustainable development index for Chinese power companies was 59.34, and the environment, society, governance, and economic scores were 62.10, 64.49, 76.79, and 41.37, respectively. (3) Based on the results of the dashboard, investment in innovation, public welfare, emissions of greenhouse gases, and economic sustainability are the key factors limiting the achievement of sustainable development. (4) The framework’s robustness analysis showed that the results of the evaluation of this paper’s indicator framework fell within a reasonable range of variation using different ranking and weighting systems. Chinese electricity companies should comprehensively control costs and expenses, strengthen capital management, expand funding channels, focus on enhancing R&D capabilities, enhance their scientific and technological innovation management systems, and improve their disclosure of information about greenhouse gas emissions, resource consumption and use, and employee issues to improve the overall level of sustainable development. The evaluation system developed in this paper further enriches the evaluation of corporate sustainability performance. This paper explored the application of the SDG index and dashboard construction methods at the national level to the evaluation of sustainability at the corporate level, providing a clear picture of corporate performance with respect to various dimensions, issues, criteria, and indicators. © 2023 by the authors.},

The dominant strategies for our sampled firms are to improve overall ESG performance by enhancing the E and S pillars through sacrificing G's performance. The second result shows a positive relationship between proportional efficiency and financial performance while a mixed relationship between pillar mix efficiency and financial performance. However, for the technology sector, there exists some trade-offs between ESG performance and financial performance. Specifically, relative to non-technology firms, improving proportional and pillar mix efficiencies for technology firms could result in some sacrifice in stock valuation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Using a broad international sample with firms from 47 countries―and through multilevel and panel data analysis―results show a positive and significant influence of CSP on CFP, while country sustainability negatively moderates the CSP–CFP relationship. This is consistent with the idea that in countries with a high level of sustainability, firms have greater difficulty obtaining competitive advantages through actions related to corporate social responsibility. Results also indicate that country sustainability has a direct and positive impact on CFP (Tobin's-Q), regardless of CSP. Additionally, applying country sustainability in a disaggregated manner, we find that social and governance dimensions influence the CSP–CFP relationship, while the environmental dimension does not. Evidence thus confirms that the effect of CSP on CFP varies depending on the institutional context in which the firm is located. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

As a contribution to previous literature, the moderating role of managers' perception in the conceptual model is explored. A survey has been conducted to obtain data about the association of ESG commitment with sustainability literacy, sustainability reporting credibility, SDGs awareness, sustainability, and financial performance. Top managers from Greek financial institutions were reviewed via an online questionnaire, during the third wave of the pandemic. The results of inductive analysis provide evidence that the sample displays good reliability and internal consistency. Particularly, dichotomous variables demonstrate internal contingency, whereas liker-scaled variables exhibit significant correlation. It seems that sustainable development and SDGs awareness are positively correlated with ESG commitment according, while business commitment to environmental issues is inversely proportional to the negative economic impact of the pandemic to corporate sustainability performance. Eventually, it turns out that ESG commitment does affect corporate sustainability on the areas of sustainability reporting credibility, SDGs awareness, sustainability, and financial performance. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

This highly regulated sector means it is under constant scrutiny for health, safety, and ethical compliance risks by federal regulatory bodies. Despite higher monitoring, an increasing number of healthcare companies receive fines for their irresponsible practices, manifesting significant questions about their corporate governance and sustainability practices. Against this backdrop, this study examines the relationship between boardroom diversity on the sustainability performance of companies operating in healthcare. Utilizing a global sample of publicly listed healthcare companies, using panel regression data and the system-GMM estimator accounting for endogeneity, we find evidence of a positive association between board diversity (gender and culture) and sustainability performance. These findings support critical mass theoretical expectations for board diversity and sustainability performance, suggesting that a meaningful representation (three or more) of women and ethnic directors on the board of healthcare organizations significantly improves sustainability performance. The findings remain robust in a series of robustness tests and continue to hold after accounting for potential endogeneity concerns.

Design/methodology/approach: The empirical study examines a sample of 211 S&P 500 firms over the 2011 to 2019 period and uses the quantile estimation method. Findings: The results show that two dimensions of ESG disclosure (the social and governance dimensions) and green innovation positively affect financial performance. This result suggests that sustainability tools have a strong financial impact. The positive relationship between green innovation and financial performance is detected at the 10th quantile up to the 70th quantile. This finding suggests that financial performance needs a moderate investment in green innovation. When considering the joint effect of ESG disclosure and green innovation, our findings show that the positive impact of some ESG disclosure dimensions (social and governance) on financial performance is more observable with a moderate investment in green innovation. Originality/value: This study highlights the prominent role of sustainability tools in financial performance. Despite the contributions of the literature, to our knowledge, the relationship between these tools and financial performance is not yet comprehensively investigated.

	abstract = {During the pandemic, all countries of the world were affected by a health pandemic was the largest in the twenty-first century, which affected the performance of companies and put them in a difficult situation with the escalation of uncertainty. Our study evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on firms' financial performance and the moderating role of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance in this relationship. Based on a large international panel dataset that includes nine countries from G20 extracted from the Thomson Reuters EIKON database for the period from 2016 to 2021, a set of statistical analyses was applied, including descriptive statistics, correlation matrix, fixed effect regression, and robust regression using GMM model. The findings indicate that the pandemic negatively affected financial performance significantly, while the performance of ESG limits this effect. Thus, companies engaged in ESG activities are the least affected during the pandemic. Fulfilling stakeholders' demands enhances companies' performance during crises and corporate directors' resort to maintaining the performance of ESG as one of the effective strategies during the crisis to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on financial performance. This study shows that compliance with ESG issues can mitigate negative financial impacts during crises and that while implementing ESG practices is costly, it satisfies stakeholders and generates financial gains for companies. Theoretically, we directed the theoretical lens to research through crisis and stakeholder theories to explain events. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

We propose that the presence of outside directors in the board is relevant to explain the performance of family firms, because they better deal with mechanisms that reduce the type II agency conflicts. Theoretical framework – Based on agency theory and its derivatives, we capture the specificities of family firms relative to non-family firms. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing from an extensive and updated database of over 370 publicly listed companies in Brazil, this study conducted panel data regressions with fixed effects on three different response variables, in order to have a broader perspective and reduce the bias of the results. Moreover, we performed robustness tests with different measurement methods. In addition, we tested the selection of variables by addressing both internal and external validity criteria, in addition to convergent and nomological validity, according to the literature. Findings – The empirical results indicate that there is a relationship between board independence and short-term financial performance for a cohort of family firms. Practical & social implications of research – This research contributes to various stakeholders by providing relevant insights about an important ESG criterion, which opens up a path for further studies. Originality/value – This is a novel approach to relevant phenomena from the perspective of family firms compared to non-family firms.

The ‘biblioshiny’ R package, also known as ‘bibliometrix 3.0’, was employed to conduct bibliometric analysis, utilising mapping and clustering techniques on 260 articles, in order to distil the comprehensive knowledge and identify emerging trends in ESG, SRI, ethical, and impact investing. The thematic map classified the ESG, SRI, ethical, impact investing and performance relationship themes into four categories of themes: niche themes (SRI, engagement and ESG), motor themes (corporate financial performance, corporate social performance, ESG, ESG factors, sustainability, performance, integrated reporting, gender diversity, and board size), emerging or declining themes (social responsibility, environmental performance, socially responsible investment, ethical investment, and SRI), and basic or transversal themes (financial performance, corporate social performance, ESG performance, environmental, social, and governance). Socially responsible investing, engagement, and ESG imply a position between niche themes and a highly developed topic/emerging or a decreasing theme, while the impact of COVID-19 on sustainability and financial performance implies a position between a highly developed topic/emerging or decreasing theme and a basic theme. The findings contribute to the enhanced understanding of ESG, SRI, ethical, impact investing and performance, which are crucial for an efficient capital market in promoting sustainability and sustainable development. The study offers vital practical implications and future research directions. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The board of directors of an organization can contribute considerably to the transition to a sustainable global economy by accommodating environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures in the directors' business model. Along these lines, the purpose of this research is to understand the nexus between the board's structural attributes and sustainability disclosures in an emerging economy such as India. Design/methodology/approach: The authors investigate this link using the system generalized method of moments (SGMM) panel regression on a sample of firms from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) Nifty 100 Index from 2013 to 2020. This econometric framework controls endogeneity among the variables, which has been a gap in the previous studies. Findings: The authors find that board structural attributes, like board size, gender diversity, chief executive officer (CEO) duality and independence, have little bearing on sustainability disclosures of Indian companies. However, the board of directors, through the board's company's social responsibility (CSR) committee, strives for sustainability practices in Indian organizations. The authors also find that larger companies are more willing to disclose on ESG efforts than smaller ones, but the financial performance of the smaller ones (as proxied by Tobin's Q) does not matter. Research limitations/implications: This study is restricted to a sample of large cap listed companies and specific environment, resulting in the non-generalizability of the findings to different contexts because countries vary in their state of economic development, internal policy, regulations and governance. Practical implications: A mandated CSR committee has helped Indian businesses to publicize their sustainability efforts. Besides the frontrunner in CSR regulations, Indian organizations have paid least attention to the environmental pillar of the ESG framework. Accordingly, the board of directors should put more emphasis on the environmental aspects of their business' sustainability efforts to help achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the medium term and net neutrality in the long term. Originality/value: From the standpoint of an emerging economy like India, which has statutory CSR mandates for firms, this research adds a fresh perspective on the relationship between corporate governance and corporate responsibility by employing stakeholder theory, which is further substantiated by the use of system GMM as a robust methodology. This study also emphasizes the significance of a mandatory CSR committee as a facilitator of sustainability practices and reporting in emerging economies. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Our results show that Board Diversity, Inclusion and People Development contribute positively to social performance disclosure, whereas Board Controversies negatively affect the dependent variable. Furthermore, the study results reveal that the country’s legal system is relevant to the company’s transparency. The model variables determine 62% of the social performance reporting variance.

We studied the effects of DJSI inclusion using data through 2021. For additions, we found significant positive pre-announcement effects, as well as persistence of positive abnormal returns. On deletions, we also saw positive abnormal returns, although significance reduced in later years. Our analysis demonstrated a stronger information role of DJSI inclusion for non-S&P 500 firms, which suggests that the DJSI is relatively more important for firms with lower investor recognition. We used a generalised synthetic control approach to estimate our results, which responds to the parallel trends critique of stock return event studies and provides robustness to industry shocks that are so important to ESG applications. Thus, this paper represents an important extension to our understanding of the value relevance of DJSI membership. © 2023 The Author(s)},

The financial performance of the companies was calculated using public financial data from the annual financial statements, while the environmental, social, and governance (ESG), and controversies scores were used as performance metrics for sustainability at company level. To evaluate financial performance a variety of indicators were used, such as assets management, debt management or market value performance, as a benchmark tool to compare the standing of companies in each sector of activity analyzed. Our findings showed that there are different relations (strong or weak) between financial performance and sustainability if a sectoral-based approach is considered. As a result, the link between financial performance and sustainability was tested on a sample of more than 5,000 companies divided into 10 sectors of activities, according to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), for the period 2017-2021.

Factors like company size, leverage, growth, age, board size, and ownership concentration were integrated as control variables. The results underscored a positive association between both holistic ESG performance and its individual dimensions (environmental, social, and governance performance) and financial outcomes. Notably, non-state-owned enterprises exhibited a more pronounced positive relationship between ESG performance and financial results than their state-owned counterparts. Drawing from these insights, it's advocated that companies amplify their efforts towards ESG performance enhancement. It further accentuates the need for regulatory bodies to formulate pertinent policies and amplify oversight.

Panel data of 494 non-financial listed Chinese firms from 2018 to 2022 are analyzed. By employing a robust econometric approach of GMM, we control the model for industry effects, time effects, and potential endogeneity issues. Furthermore, we employ a rigorous and comprehensive approach, utilizing a six-dimensional index to measure boardroom diversity as moderating variable. We find a significant and positive impact of ESG and its sub-dimensions (i.e., environment, social, and governance) on firm performance; nonetheless, the existence of diverse perspectives in the boardroom is found to have a negative impact on the relationship between ESG and FFP. Then, by analyzing the sub-dimensions of BRD, we find that overseas background, degree, age and affiliations diversity have a significantly negative impact, while the impact of function diversity is not statistically significant and the impact of gender diversity is positive and significant. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that BRD's negative impact is more pronounced in non-SOEs and firms with large board size and short board tenure. These findings have important policy implications for managers and practitioners by supporting companies adopting ESG practices. However, they should also be cautious about conflicts when considering boardroom diversity and ESG initiatives regarding FFP. A stable and less divisive corporate governance environment is of great help to ESG practices. We suggest an approach where efforts could be made to promote board diversity that best aligns with sustainability goals. © 2023},

Using a sample of 1,072 Korean listed firms from 2011 through 2019, we show that ESG performance is positively associated with firm value. This positive association almost disappears, however, for firms that fall into the below-median ROA group. Moreover, the value implications of ESG performance decrease monotonically as a firm’s financial performance worsens from the highest to the lowest ROA quartile, resulting in a negative value effect of ESG performance for firms that fall into the lowest ROA quartile. Lastly, this association is more pronounced among firms that suffer from severe information asymmetry. The results suggest overall that investor valuations of ESG performance depend on financial performance. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Findings showed the absence of social reporting and the disclosure of business governance, including sustainability strategy, and the poor reporting of the environmental and social pillars, except for product innovation, product quality, and responsible marketing themes. The capability of ESG disclosure to predict corporate profitability and access to credit is limited. Moreover, investments in product responsibility are negatively related to the cost of debt, while commitment toward the internal and external companies' community appears to predict their ability to access credit positively. In light of the new institutional pressures requiring small agri-food businesses to change and combine intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for CSR, the study extends the literature on the sustainability of small agri-food businesses, which is mostly limited, and provides significant practical and political contributions to foster the paradigm shift toward sustainability [EconLit Citations: M21, Q01, Q13]. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

The study uses the ordinary least squares (OLS) and the two-stage least squares method (2SLS) as the baseline models and further enhances robustness with sub-sample analysis. Findings: The results demonstrate a positive link between renewable energy use and financial performance, and these results hold up across different measurements, sub-sample analysis and model specifications, demonstrating their robustness. Furthermore, the results indicate that some factors such as the industry nature and environmental, social and governance (ESG) controversies have an impact on this positive association. Practical implications: The findings are substantial for both policymakers and companies, highlighting the benefits of incorporating renewable energy into their operations for improved business success. Originality/value: This study adds to the existing body of literature on the effect of environmental performance on a company’s success by focusing on a novel aspect – the correlation between renewable energy usage and firm performance.

This study attempts to determine how corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental protection measures influence the financial performance of Indian businesses. A panel dataset containing 330 Nifty 500 companies is included to determine their relationship. The quarterly and semi-annual share prices are employed as proxies for the financial performance of companies. In the regression model, the lagged share prices (log) of two periods serve as the response variable, while the CSR and the CSR plus the environment and pollution control expenses (CSREP) serve as explanatory variables. The results suggest that the fixed-effect regression model is suitable where the explanatory variables are time-invariant and the relationship between the dependent and explanatory variables across firms is constant over time. Our analysis indicates that CSR spending alone has little effect on the share prices of companies over two prospective time periods. However, as companies invest more in environmental and pollution control activities in addition to their CSR expenditure, the market recognises this as a significant factor, and their share prices rise. Consequently, we discovered that CSREP (CSR plus environmental and pollution control expenditure) is a significant factor that influences quarterly and semi-annual share prices. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

First, the regression analyses confirm the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis and an inverted N-shaped curve in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Second, the deciding factors are the result of the interaction of the following five points, which have been more encouraged and promoted in Japan in recent years: (1) Regulatory reforms such as energy market opening; (2) investors’ emphasis on environment, society, and governance (ESG); (3) guidelines and assessments by economic organizations, rating agencies, and environmental nonprofit groups; (4) citizens’ professional ethics and willingness for environmental conservation and social contribution; and (5) endogenous efforts by the public utilities as members of society. Third, an approach that focuses on ESG and total shareholders return (TSR) can contribute not only to the achievement of both growth and environmental conservation but also to the expansion of the academic literature. © 2023, Econjournals.

We empirically examine the implications of institutional theory within the banking sector context and provide classification of our sampled banks. In addition, a tailored sustainability index has been developed and content analysis has been employed to examine the current sustainability disclosure in the EU and the US banking sector. Using a sample of 483 report-year observations, the results reveal that the EU banks have carried out more sustainability disclosure compared with US banks, and banks in both regions are mostly interested in how their operations influence the society that banks operate in (direct social impact), followed by the indirect environmental impact of their products and services. We find evidence of the applicability of institutional theory in sustainability communications within our sample. Therefore, our findings provide a clearer breakdown of sustainability disclosure in the banking sector using a cross-country context. Finally, we update our sample to include 67 EU banks matched by 67 US banks for the period from 2013 to 2021 and use ESG scores to reflect the sustainability dimension and we report that EU banks outperform the US banks in three dimensions (the direct social, the direct environmental and the indirect social scores), while the US banks have the lead in the indirect environmental sustainability scores. © 2022 The Authors.

This study uses a difference-in-differences analysis on data of publicly listed Nordic firms, showing a positive and significant difference in revenue and profitability for firms listed in lockdown countries compared with those in the country without a lockdown. Further analysis shows that sustainability provides resilience for firms during the COVID-19 pandemic, as firms' environmental and social performances are positively related to revenue, profitability, and valuation.

The results obtained show that having women on boards of directors has a non-significant positive effect on EVA®, which diminishes as women’s participation on the board increases. Theory suggests that more diverse boards of directors exercise better control, leading to improved financial results.

We empirically analyze a sample of 5762 firms across several sectors from 23 developed countries from 2013 to 2017.

Given the critical role that shareholders have in approving director appointments, we analyze voting patterns in director elections to investigate whether and how shareholders value board diversity. Using a broad sample of director elections from 2008 through 2018, we find evidence that shareholders provide greater voting support for diversity on boards, particularly gender diversity. Our findings also indicate greater additional support for diverse boards rather than for individual candidates. However, the magnitude of incremental voting support for diversity is small, and we find little evidence that the additional support is sufficient to affect voting outcomes. These findings persist over time and across key institutional shareholders who have been some of the most outspoken proponents of board diversity (i.e., SRI funds), questioning shareholders’ commitment to promoting board diversity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Integrated reporting provides opportunities through which companies can increase transparency about their business activities, including environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. ESG has become increasingly important as a key component of business competitiveness. Using multiple regression models, we empirically investigate the influence of ownership structure on the quality of integrated reporting. Based on a sample of 1,017 integrated reports from Asian and European regions for the period of 2016-2019, we hypothesize and find that companies with dispersed ownership show higher quality integrated reporting as compared to companies with concentrated ownership. Companies with dispersed ownership face a higher level of pressure from various individuals and institutional shareholders, leading to more effective control of the companies' operations. By contrast, companies with concentrated ownership tend to be influenced more by the majority of the shareholders, leading to less effective control of the companies' operations. Our study contributes to the literature on gaining and maintaining competitive advantages through ESG initiatives by providing evidence that the pressures from various shareholders to invest in ESG activities are beneficial for companies marketplace competitiveness. Our study suggests that companies need to diversify their ownership to improve their financial as well as non-financial performance. © 2023 The Author(s).},

All the three dimensions of corporate sustainability involve taxation; therefore, it is important to establish if this association reflects on financial performance. Our analysis of worldwide property and casualty (P&C) insurers during 2013–2022 reveals that high ESG insurers pay more taxes, while they are less profitable compared to low ESG insurers. This pattern is confirmed using instrumental variable regressions and simultaneous equations systems. We argue that sustainable insurers are less tempted to avoid taxes and do not shift their tax burdens onto policyholders and investors. However, the interplay between taxes and sustainability seems to harm insurers’ profitability, potentially having negative effects on investment and economic growth. This is an important insight for tax authorities and insurance managers. © 2023 by the author.},

They were supported by numerous rating agencies that developed a large number of indices and reporting standards to facilitate the choice of the most sustainable companies from an ESG perspective. When the relationship between financial performance and sustainability was analyzed, the researchers did not reach an unanimously accepted conclusion: many studies show a positive relationship, while others show a negative one. In many studies, the relationship between ESG performance and financial performance, assessed through profitability rates was privileged. The aim of this study is to investigate if there is a relationship between ESG performance and the liquidity rates of the listed companies from emerging financial markets in European Union. The emerging markets in European Union were selected due to their attractiveness, as they offer high earning possibilities to investors. At the same time, aspects regarding the mandatory of non-financial sustainability reporting, starting from 2023, were taken into account. This will increase the comparability and homogeneity of ESG scores, but will also generate additional reporting costs, putting suplimentary pressure on companies.  © 2023 Diana Elena Vasiu, published by Sciendo.},

Moreover, better ESG disclosure and carbon performance also reduce default risk. We interpret our results as the beneficial impact of ESG on lowering default risk depends on the threshold level of ESG investment.

	abstract = {This research article examines the relationship between women’s empowerment and corporate ESG disclosure variables by analyzing 10,121 publicly traded companies listed worldwide with historical ESG data available in Bloomberg from 2016 to 2020. The paper seeks to answer whether corporate gender diversity directly affects companies’ ESG disclosure by using proprietary Bloomberg ESG disclosure scores and independent variables such as the female board and executive representation. Control variables, like the company’s return on equity, total debt ratio, and the natural logarithm of total assets as a proxy measurement of the firm’s size, are also included. Results provide evidence that policies that foster corporate gender diversity directly benefit from enhanced ESG-related disclosure, thus helping to trigger national dialogues about suitable corporate gender diversity strategies influencing firms’ ESG disclosure. This paper makes a unique contribution to the literature by being the first to analyze the effects of women’s empowerment on ESG disclosure using a globally representative sample. The evidence of the benefits of women’s empowerment associated with corporate ESG disclosure suggests that organizations with a more gender-diverse corporate board and executive team are more likely to have higher levels of ESG disclosure, as gender diversity increases the likelihood of organizational transparency and accountability, and can lead to improved corporate value. Governments should use this evidence to implement policies promoting women’s empowerment in the corporate world, ultimately leading to improved corporate ESG disclosure. © 2023 by the authors.},

This noteworthy shift in perspective has catalyzed the inception of this research, which seeks to scrutinize the influence of environmental, social, and governance disclosure (ESGD) on financial distress. To investigate the potential capacity of ESGD in mitigating financial distress, the researchers have employed the Generalized Method of Moments. Additionally, the study takes into account the moderating role played by the firm’s life cycle in this relationship. The findings underscore that the adoption of ESGD is associated with a decreased likelihood of default, thus highlighting its effectiveness as a risk management strategy. Moreover, this investigation emphasizes the impact of the firm’s life cycle on the link between ESGD and corporate financial distress. Rooted in signalling theory as the theoretical framework, the research posits that a wide spectrum of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives not only enhances the consistency of signals but also amplifies the associated signal costs. Consequently, in alignment with this theoretical perspective and substantiated by empirical evidence, our study confirms a multifaceted influence of ESGD on financial distress, contingent upon the distinctive phases of a firm's life cycle. In consequence, this study offers valuable insights for managerial decision-making, guiding the development of tailored disclosure policies that align with the specific characteristics of a firm’s life cycle. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.},

Design/methodology/approach: Using the content analysis technique, the data was collected from 124 nonfinancial companies from Levant countries (Jordan, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon), and 883 observations were collected as panel data for the research analysis. Findings: The findings indicate that the environmental, social and ESG collective performance maximizes financial performance, while the governance performance influences ROA only. This suggests that companies pay great attention to various stakeholders, mainly external. Maximizing stakeholder value remains an optimal strategy to achieve the company’s financial goals. Thus, improving the disclosure levels of nonfinancial performance in the capital markets will improve the chances of growth of the financial performance indicators of companies.

	abstract = {Despite the spread and progress in the literature related to the disclosure of corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance around the world as one of the most essential tools for achieving sustainable development in society, its value relevance is still uncertain. Using a survey approach involving investors dealing in stocks of 60 enterprises listed on the Egyptian Stock Exchange (EGX) and included in the environmental, social, and governance index (S&P/EGX ESG index) and the equal-weight index (EGX100 EWI index), we empirically examine the importance of CSR financial performance disclosure by examining the extent to which it can influence investors’ choices. In addition, we assess whether company reputation acquired through online social media (OSM) influences the extent to which CSR performance disclosure influences such judgments. To examine these matters, we conduct two tests: the first examines the influence of disclosure of company environmental activities on investors’ decisions and the other examines the influence of disclosure of company social activities on investor decisions. Turning to our key results, we find that investment decision makers in both experiments tend to invest only in companies that have higher CSR performance scores. In the context of OSM, we provide and discuss empirical evidence that investment decision makers are more responsive to investing in companies included in the S&P/EGX ESG index, which have a positive e-reputation for CSR performance, than companies included in the EGX100 EWI index, which do not have such a reputation, which confirms that e-reputation, as one of the most important outputs of OSM, has a marginal impact on investment decisions and moderates the relation between disclosure of high CSR scores and investors’ decisions. Therefore, this paper presents a modern starting point for CSR experts and academics, particularly in the emerging markets. In general, our paper expands the CSR-related investment literature. In line with the affect-as-information theory, our paper also expands the OSM literature by indicating that the effects of OSM depend on the information context, where failure to provide information to investors or other stakeholders in a timely manner may render the information useless. © 2023 by the authors.},

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues are therefore gaining increasing importance, in line with the growing demand for corporate sustainability. ESG ratings foster the comparison of companies with respect to their sustainable practices. This study aims to investigate how ESG ratings impact financial performance in the European food industry. Ordinary least squares regression is applied to analyze the relation between ESG ratings and financial performance over a 4-year period from 2017 to 2020. The profitability measures Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) are employed as financial performance measures, while ESG ratings are obtained from the database CSRHub. Results show that higher ESG ratings are associated with better financial performance. Although the effect is modest in the present study, the findings support previous results that ESG ratings are positively related to financial performance. Nonetheless, they also highlight that ESG ratings strongly converge to the mean, which depicts the need to reassess whether ESG ratings are able to measure actual ESG behavior. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Despite the growing demand for corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) engagement in response to the global complex crisis, the impacts of ESG activities and market environment on firm performance have not been sufficiently investigated. This study aims to explore how ESG activities affect firm performance and how the competitive market environment moderates this relationship. The panel data regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between the ESG performance and firm performance (specifically, market capitalization as a measure of market-based firm performance and profit margin and return on assets as measures of account-based firm performance) with the data of 2115 listed companies from 53 countries over the past 5 years (2017–2021). The analysis results showed a U-shaped relation between ESG performance and market capitalization, and a positive linear relationship was observed between ESG performance and profit margin or return on assets. Importantly, it was found that these relationships are negatively moderated by the competition (number of competitors) in the market. It can be interpreted that the greater the number of competitors in the market, the weaker the effect of ESG performance on firm performance. This study discusses plausible reasons for these observations and managerial and policy implications drawn from the results. This study not only analyzes the relationship between ESG performance and various aspects of firm performance at the global level, but also accumulates new evidence for the moderating effect of market competition. © 2023 The Authors.

Our research addresses this knowledge gap, utilizing a two-pronged analytical approach to the ESG controversies data of Vigeo-Eiris. We examine general trends and patterns in the sampling of 20,144 media sources over a 20-year period (2000–2019). This quantitative study is complemented by a qualitative, case-based analysis of the Kazakh operations of a multinational steel manufacturing company to further explore and contextualize the ESG controversies coverage of three leading ESG information providers (Vigeo-Eiris, RepRisk and Sustainalytics). We discover significant selection bias in the media sources that underlie the ESG controversies data, which presents a hitherto undetected risk for investors. Of note, the odds of being covered as part of a controversy are five times higher for companies headquartered in English-language countries than for companies in other language regions. Our study contributes by opening the black box of ESG controversies, scrutinizing their underlying sampling methodologies and highlighting the trade-off between completeness and cost of available ESG information. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: Based on a sample of 1,872 firm-year observations for 573 global firms over the period 2013–2016, this study aims to provide empirical evidence on how environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance affects corporate creditworthiness as measured by credit default swap (CDS) spreads. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a regression model that accounts for country, industry and time-fixed effects as well as the instrumental-based Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) approach to dynamic panel modeling. Findings: This study finds that improvements in ESG performance, especially in its governance pillar, reduce credit risk. Further, the authors uncover evidence suggesting the complementarity between ESG performance and country-level sustainability. The results indicate a stronger risk-mitigating impact of ESG performance in countries with higher sustainability scores. Practical implications: In terms of practical implications, the findings suggest that corporations should strengthen governance frameworks and procedures to reduce credit risk, prior to embarking on environmental and social objectives. Further, the finding that country sustainability is an important determinant of CDS spreads suggests that country-level sustainability initiatives would not only help to preserve natural capital and promote social capital but also be beneficial to businesses and financial stability. Originality/value: The study adds to the literature on the effects of ESG performance on credit risk by (1) utilizing a measure of ESG performance that considers the financial materiality of ESG issues across different industries; (2) utilizing a market-based measure of credit risk and CDS spreads; (3) examining the relative importance of ESG components to credit risk, rather than just the aggregate measure; and (4) assessing the influence of country sustainability on the relationship between ESG and credit risk. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Many businesses view sustainability issues as important and design corporate sustainability strategies. However, creating such a strategy does not mean the company will progress in sustainable development because the factors influencing businesses remain largely unexplored. Based on a review of studies on corporate sustainability, we identified the major factors affecting any company’s sustainability. They include government regulation, imperfect management, interaction with stakeholders, corporate self-regulation and self-reflection, and the regulatory framework, and can be consolidated into two groups. We also analyzed the groups of methods that can be used to assess a company’s sustainability: traditional corporate sustainability assessment methods, circular economy assessment methods, ESG assessment methods, and non-financial performance indicators. For each group of methods, limitations were identified, and it was concluded that corporate sustainability assessments should factor in the environment in which the company operates. As part of this study, a lack of methods for assessing the corporate sustainability of coal companies was revealed, along with insufficient consideration of industrial factors in the prior literature. These factors are responsible for incorrect corporate sustainability assessments in the coal industry. Taking into account the division of Russian coal companies into three types (energy companies, metal manufacturers, and coal producers) and the aspects of their functioning against the backdrop of economic restrictions (including sanctions and embargoes), the authors prove that each group of companies requires an individual corporate sustainability assessment methodology. © 2023 by the authors.},

Building on Campbell and Shiller's present value decomposition and using an instrumental variables-based methodology to address measurement errors in ESG scores, in this paper we analyze the effects of corporate ESG performance on expected dividend growth and discount rates for oil and gas firms in Latin America (Latam). On the one hand, our results suggest that ESG policies developed by oil and gas firms in Latam are related to lower medium-term discount rates. On the other hand, ESG practices adopted by oil and gas companies are also related to lower future dividend growth. These findings suggest that the lower discount rates resulting from active ESG policies at least partially offset the costs derived from the green transition of the oil and gas sector in Latam, meaning that the efforts made by oil and gas companies to improve their ESG performance, together with public initiatives aimed at covering a portion of the costs derived from corporate ESG policies, can make some unexploitable oil reserves in Latam become viable. © 2023 The Authors},

Therefore, two portfolios with high and low CSR performance were formed from stocks traded in Borsa Istanbul. These portfolios’ performances were compared from July 2010 to June 2020. The findings show that the alpha coefficient of the portfolio containing stocks of companies with high CSR performance is generally positive and significant. Thus, companies’ past CSR performances provide valuable information for investors. Additionally, based on this, investors can achieve a superior performance against the market. However, the alpha of the difference portfolio, which shows the difference between the two portfolios’ performance, is, in most cases, insignificant. This suggests that there is no proof that the portfolio comprising companies with high CSR performance is superior to the portfolio including companies with low CSR performance. These findings are supported by additional testing. Consequently, our result provides supporting evidence for the “no effect” hypothesis. © The Author(s) 2023.},

The study data set included more than 80 website observation items, data about downloadable annual sustainability reports, financial performance data and the environmental scores in the CDP Rating and the Refinitiv ESG Scores. Descriptive statistical analyses and correlation analyses were performed for the entire sample and for the regional subsets of the sample. One of the major results is that all regions show low levels of website disclosure. However, some variation in the extent of disclosure was found. The lowest level of disclosure was found for Chinese websites. Higher levels were observed for the companies from Europe, Japan and the United States. The analysis of the reports revealed that only one-third of the sample companies from China but more than half of the companies from Europe, Japan and the United States supply recent reports. It was also found that integrated reports are less used in the United States, particularly when compared with companies from Europe and Japan. Insights also suggest that there is a weak to moderate correlation between one of the disclosure scores used and the Refinitiv ESG Scores. Further correlation analyses did not provide indications that company age and financial performance are to be considered determining factors of environmental website disclosure. © 2022 The Authors.

Using ESG performance data of 4978 firms from 48 countries for 17 years, we argue that the financial return from engaging in ESG varies depending on the countries’ cultural aspects because stakeholder evaluations and appreciations for a firm's ESG performance differ across nations. We find that a country that espouses a culture of high individualism or masculinity tends to appreciate and reflect on this more explicitly, strengthening the relationship between a firm's ESG performance and financial performance. Contrastingly, in a country with a culture of high power distance or uncertainty avoidance, firms’ ESG efforts are less likely to be associated with financial performance. Our findings have important implications for multinational enterprises facing various cultural environments when dealing with heterogeneous stakeholder demands across countries. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach: Using data culled from 3,311 observations from 50 different countries over a ten-year period (2008–2017), an ESG-score-derived independent variable is regressed against dependent performance indicator variables (operation ratio, return on equity and Tobin’s Q). Two types of control variables complete the regression analysis in this study: firm-specific and macroeconomic. Findings: The findings of this study elicited from the empirical results demonstrate that there is a significant relationship between ESG and operational performance (operation ratio). However, there is no significant relationship between ESG and financial performance (return on equity) and market performance (Tobin’s Q). However, the relationship between ESG and operation ratio is stronger in emerging than in developed economies. Originality/value: The model in this study presents a valuable analytical framework for exploring sustainability reporting as a driver of performance across energy sectors in both developed and emerging economies. In addition, this study highlights energy-sectorial managerial implications contrasting developed, as juxtaposed with, emerging economies. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {ESG ratings have emerged as a critical instrument for investors to evaluate the long-term risks and ethical dimensions of companies. These ratings quantify companies' performance in environmental, social, and governance aspects. Neverthe-less, variations in ESG ratings persist across nations owing to distinct regulatory regimes and rating agency methodologies. Despite extensive scholarly attention to the influence of global ESG factors, Asian ratings have been barely scrutinized. The research aims to assess the influence of ESG ratings on the financial performance of companies in Asia, with particular focus on South-West Asia (Turkey, Israel, and Saudi Arabia) and South-East Asia (China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia). The study, which gathered data from 276 firms over a five-year period (2018–2022), employed STATA software to conduct panel data regressions, with return on assets, return on equity, and price-to-book value serving as dependent variables. First, the results of hypothesis testing show that ESG ratings have a positive effect on financial performance in South-West Asia, but not in South-East Asia where they have a negative effect. Second, in South-West Asia, one of the environmental, social, or governance (ESG) factors has a more notable influence and results in positive financial ratios, while in South-East Asia, there is no influence from the ESG factors. The study found that ESG ratings have varying effects on financial performance in South-West and South-East Asia, which may be attributed to differences in the historical and cultural development of ESG issues. This study will aid in the development of ESG rating practices for Asian countries. © 2023, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics. All rights reserved.},

However, the impact of company ownership on environmental performance remains unclear. This study aims to address this gap by examining the relationship between company ownership and company interest in measuring the environmental impact of its supply chains, as the environmental aspect is directly linked to supply chain activities and has quantifiable measures. Using random effects ordered logistic regression on panel data from 2017 to 2022 for 2811 companies, we show that companies with long-term investment sources demonstrate a greater interest in measuring environmental variables in their supply chain compared to those financed with short-term investments. Sovereign wealth funds and other long-term investment sources exhibit a positive and significant correlation with higher utilization of ESG indicators in the supply chain. These findings suggest that policymakers and private companies aiming to enhance sustainability should prioritize longer-term investment sources, which display stronger commitments to sustainability and ESG practices and are more likely to use environmental initiatives in their supply chains. © 2023 by the authors.},

Moreover, the objective of the study is to investigate the sustainability practices with mediation of board member experience, which might contribute in maintaining the share performance. The study is unique in such a way that instead of analysing the stated relationship with internal financial performance measures such as return on asset (ROA) or return on equity (ROE), this study will investigate the relationship using external performance measures such as firm share performance. In this research, data were collected from 100 Bursa Malaysia listed companies using purposive sampling during the sampling period from 2017 to 2020. The data were analysed using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bound testing model instead of a traditional regression model to examine the causal relationship. The results of the study showed the long-run steady relationships through the error correction term (ECT) at the optimum lag. Further, the findings also revealed that there is no short run association between the sustainability practices and the stock performance with mediation of the board experience. The findings also showed that sustainability practices have a significant impact on share performance with mediation of board experience. It is found that sustainability practices, especially environmental and social, are essential to attract investors. The results have also demonstrated that a board of directors of different ages has different knowledge, competencies, and expertise which could prove beneficial in terms of board diversity that decides to adapt the best sustainability practices. These findings provide some inference for future research on the relationship of sustainability practices and share performance with other mediating factors of board attributes. © 2022 by the authors.},

Furthermore, regions in southern and particularly eastern Europe, which are critical given regulators’ objectives for European Union-wide and global sustainability standards, are neglected. Finally, studies on non-financial effects of sustainability reporting are also limited, and only a few studies differentiate between stakeholder- and shareholder-oriented countries.

The research sample includes 620 firms headquartered in Western Europe, including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, and Switzerland from 2010 to 2019. Panel data estimations are used to examine the direct and moderating effects. The results show that ESG has a significantly negative effect on a firm's financial performance as measured by the return on assets (ROA), supporting the trade-off hypothesis in which investing in ESG activities increases the cost of business. Additionally, we find that ESG's adverse influence on CFP is more evident at enterprises that are certified by Big Four accounting firms. However, ESG has a significantly positive effect on revenue, suggesting that customers are more attracted to firms that invest in ESG. The analysis of the subcomponents of ESG supports the main results. The results are robust to alternative model specifications and alternative measures of CFP and audit quality and are free of endogeneity issues. The findings contribute to the existing knowledge on ESG by elucidating the effect of external auditor quality on the ESG-CFP relationship.

An empirical analysis employing a fixed effect panel model was conducted using empirical panel data from 2011 to 2021 for 806 non-financial manufacturing and service sector companies in Korea. The main findings are the impact of corporate ESG management on corporate performance varies depending on the type of performance, E and G have a positive effect on corporate profitability, and both positive and negative effects are observed on exports. Regarding market performance, neither ESG was found to have significant effect. The diverse and disproportionate influence of ESG management on financial, market, and export performance presented in this study will provide firms with theoretical and practical implications. However, it is necessary to examine more closely whether these analysis results are the result of actual strategic choices of companies, or a phenomenon in which the level or speed of regulatory and institutional development differs by ESG sector. © 2023 by the authors.},

The main objective of the article was to verify the companies’ declarations on the convergence of sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the assessment of their actual actions. In order to achieve this objective, the authors hypothesized and adopted, among others, a multi-stage logical thinking-based methodology. In addition, several research methods were used, i.e., a review of regulations and scientific articles, a qualitative literature review—extracting and collecting information, developing a categorization framework, and a comparative method based on a case study. The study started with extracting and collecting social and environmental information disclosed by Polish mining companies at the level of declaring SDGs targets (KGHM, LW Bogdanka, and JSW). Sourced from reports and company statements. In the next step, a leader (KGHM) was selected, and a comparison was made with a global enterprise (Barrick Gold), according to the adopted categorization framework for social initiatives. Common areas of both SDGs declarations and actions for these entities were identified, and measures of their implementation were suggested. Two main metrics were proposed for the social area, i.e., health and safety in relation to the financial performance of the companies and diversity in management and supervisory bodies. The role and importance of the prioritization of ESG (environmental, social, and governance) disclosures by the industry players are indicated. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The investigation of association between board diversity and the firm performance is the subject of many studies. However, the empirical results presented in the extant literature are inconclusive at best. The inconclusive empirical results could be due to several factors and one of them could be that the relationship is contingent on some key factors. Given the rising trend of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) activities, in this paper the relationship between board diversity and the firm performance is tested in the context of ESG activities. The subject of examination in this study is the listed Chinese firms. The sample period spans for 6 years and is collected from 2014 to 2019. This work uses a dynamic approach to modelling relationships. The generalised method of moments (GMM) is used in a two-step system. An endogeneity-free estimate may be achieved by using this strategy. We can learn a great deal from these hypotheses. There is a positive and substantial correlation between board diversity and the firm's success, which suggests that diverse boards are beneficial to businesses. Both ESG activities and a positive coefficient on company performance are significant. This shows investors appreciate companies that are involved in ESG activities because they see this as an investment that pays off. Last but not least, the report shows that board diversity has a negative and considerable impact on ESG efforts. According to the results, board diversity and ESG efforts are not necessary for a company's success. According to the data, board diversity is not particularly beneficial in the context of significant ESG initiatives. Board diversity really hurts a company's success when it engages in high ESG activities. The study also discusses the work's policy ramifications. Finally, the work lays out a clear path for further study. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The result is also independent from the effect of director age which, although related to director's generational identity, captures something fundamentally different and is controlled for in all our regressions. Finally, we document that companies with Generation X directors engage in value enhancing ESG and innovation activities and facilitate the inclusion of women on the board. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

We construct a large sample of Chinese listed firms from quarterly firm-level accounting data from the China Stock Market & Accounting Research Database for the period 2019Q1–2021Q1, matched with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores, SDG performance from the WIND Database, and complemented with data on cumulative and new cases of COVID-19 from the World Health Organization. We use difference-in-differences to investigate any causal effect from COVID-19. We find that COVID-19 induces financial constraints in firms. Further, differing from the existing literature on the determinants of SDGs, we explore the supportive role of SDG performance on firm financial performance and show that ESG can better describe SDG performance and alleviate financial constraints. Moreover, both internal and external financial intermediaries improve with enhanced ESG performance in overcoming financial constraints. Our findings strongly indicate that a sustainable development strategy facilitates efficient adaptation to financial challenges and assists in overcoming external shocks. © 2021, European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).},

This is important because prior related literature focused on data containing times of economic crises. We measure bankruptcy likelihood with the Altman Z score and CSP with Refinitiv ESG scores. By applying static panel data regressions and instrumental variable regressions on a sample of 6696 US-firm-year observations from 2010 to 2019 our main findings are: (i) In contrast to existing research, the level of firms’ CSP seems to have no (positive) effect on the likelihood of bankruptcy during times of economic upswing. (ii) Increasing a firm’s CSP in times of economic upswing leads to a rise in bankruptcy likelihood. We conclude that the positive effects of CSP on stakeholder relationships fail to materialize in flourishing business environments. The costs of increasing CSP, thus, exceed their immediate positive effects and raise bankruptcy likelihood. However, as they reduce financial default risk in subsequent crises, CSP investments can be seen as a balancing measure. Our findings bear implications for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The financial performance variables incorporated in this paper include ROA, ROE, firm size, market capitalization, PBDIT, Tobin’s Q and share price. It is demonstrated that ESG score influences these variables, however with time lags. The distinctive contribution of the current endeavour lies in establishing a long-term positive association between ESG disclosure and annual average share price for the listed firms in a developing economy like India.

Previous studies have mainly focused on the net effects of ESG on CFP, i.e., emphasizing the individual impact of the overall ESG level or each ESG pillar on CFP. However, there is a complex causal relationship between ESG and CFP, and different combinations of ESG pillars may have a differential impact on CFP. Based on configuration theory, this paper aims to analyze how the different configurations of the ESG pillars impact CFP using the longitudinal fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) approach. Using a sample of listed new energy companies in China from 2016 to 2020, we identified two configurations that generate high CFP and four that generate low CFP. The social pillar is a determinant in generating high CFP outcomes, and it has shown stability in its configuration across time. The study will contribute to guiding new energy companies to strengthen their corporate social responsibility practices and expand the application of the fsQCA in longitudinal datasets. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

We surveyed 1,141 primary peer-reviewed papers and 27 meta-reviews (based on ∼1,400 underlying studies) published between 2015 and 2020. Aggregate conclusions from a sample suggest that the financial performance of ESG investing has on average been indistinguishable from conventional investing (with one in three studies indicating superior performance)–in contrast with research in the wider management literature as well as industry reports. Until recently top finance journals did not publish climate change related studies, yet these studies capture the frontier of corporate risk and ESG investment strategies. We developed three propositions: first, ESG integration as a strategy seems to perform better than screening or divestment; second, ESG investing provides asymmetric benefits, especially during a social or economic crisis; and third, decarbonization strategies can potentially capture a climate risk premium. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Due to the unmeasurable effects of most ESG factors on shareholder value and their subjective nature, ESG-based remuneration is vulnerable to exploitation for symbolic and self-serving purposes. For companies aiming to promote long-term shareholder value, extending the assessment period of financial performance is a less costly and risky option compared to ESG-based remuneration. Differently, for companies oriented by a stakeholder purpose, ESG-based remuneration may play a part in incentivising executives to achieve plural stakeholder interests. To mitigate the risk of exploitation, this article proposes rule tightening in the current disclosure and monitoring frameworks for executive remuneration. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {This article shows how sustainable investing—through the joint practice of exclusionary screening and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) integration—affects asset returns. I develop an asset pricing model with partial segmentation and heterogeneous preferences. I characterize two exclusion premia generalizing Merton’s (1987) premium on neglected stocks and a taste premium that clarifies the relationship between ESG and financial performance. Focusing on US stocks, I estimate the model by applying it to sin stocks as excluded assets and using the holdings of green funds to proxy for environmental integration. The average annual exclusion effect is 2.79% for the period 1999–2019. Although the annual taste effect ranges from –1.12% to þ 0.14% across industries for 2007–19, the taste effect spread between the top and bottom terciles of companies within each industry can exceed 2% per year. Finally, I estimate and explain the dynamics of these premia. © The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Finance Association. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between a company’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and its financial performance. This paper also investigates the relationship between ESG performance and a company’s market valuation. This paper provides convincing empirical evidence that delivering superior ESG performance pays off financially. Design/methodology/approach: The financial data and ESG scores of 150 publicly traded companies listed in the Standard and Poor’s 500 index for 2017–2020, comprising 5,750 observations, were collected. STATA was used to run a fixed-effect regression and a weighted least squares model to analyze the panel data. Findings: The results of the empirical analysis suggest that companies with superior ESG performance perform better financially and are valued higher in the market compared to their industry peers. The ESG rating score impacts both return-on-capital-employed as a proxy for financial performance and Tobin’s Q as a proxy for the market valuation of a company. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing research on ESG performance and financial performance relationship by providing empirical evidence to resolve confusion in the existing literature caused by contradictory evidence. Taking advantage of worldwide crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, this study shows that a positive relationship between ESG performance and a company’s market valuation holds even during times of unexpected crises. Further, this study contributes to business practitioners’ knowledge by showing that ESG aspects constitute highly relevant non-financial information that impact the market’s perception of a company and that investing in sustainability positively impacts a company’s bottom line. © 2022, Bejtush Ademi and Nora Johanne Klungseth.},

For this purpose we have conducted a review of scientific literature on this topic, established interrelation between financial indicators and ESG indicators, determined the main characteristics which influence corporate financial indicators. For this purpose we developed a model of CEO’s personal characteristics. The paper studied characteristics of CEOs from Russian companies, compiled a rating of CEOs taking into consideration financial and ESG indicators of companies, considered influence of the CEO’s position in this overall rating on financial indicators of a company. The research sample comprises 81 Russian companies of the real sector which are in the Moscow Exchange index and 123 CEOs. The time interval covered by this research is seven years since 2013 to 2019. Analysis was performed in the statistics package STATA applying panel data analysis as a method. Return on assets, return on equity and the market capitaliza-tion indicator were used as dependent variables. We chose disclosure of ESG information by a company, CEO’s score in the overall rating and such CEO’s characteristics as age, tenure and financial education as explicative variables. Financial leverage and company size were used as control variables. We also added return on assets to some model specifications in order to improve the model quality. © 2022, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics. All rights reserved.},

The euro to US dollar exchange rate is used, as the forex market is the largest financial market and considers it as the largest major pair. The Consumer Sentiment Index is used as a proxy to consumer confidence, since consumer behavior is, also, considered as a major factor linked to environmental degradation. The basic testing procedures employed include the Augmented Dickey–Fuller stationarity test, cointegration analysis and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The results establish that stock returns of companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index exert a significant negative (positive) impact on the global CO2 emissions in the short (long) term. The inverse, i.e., a significant positive (negative) impact on the short (long) run holds for the both other variables, i.e., US consumers’ confidence and euro to US dollar exchange rates. From the outcomes obtained, policy initiatives that could assist companies to mitigate environmental degradation are recommended. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the face of global systemic risks brought about by climate change, government organizations, civil societies, and enterprises globally have begun standardizing and implementing relevant contingency measures to mitigate or adapt to climate change. For example, Take SDG 13 climate action or implement various strategies for low-carbon transformation. In addition to responding to climate change commitments, these major changes have also boosted the rating scores of their ESG performance indicators, which inevitably have a certain degree of impact on their financial performance. Using the ESG performance indicators and financial data of 100 manufacturing firms worldwide from 2005 to 2020, this study constructs a multilevel quadratic growth model to analyze and investigate the effects of different types of ownership structure as well as disclosure of climate change-related risks and opportunities (CCR risks) on ESG and financial performance indicators among manufacturing industry firms. The findings of this study showed that different ownership structures, the degree of disclosure of climate change-related risks and opportunities (CCR risks), and the number of environmental performance indicators had no multiplicative effect on the financial performance of manufacturing companies. Instead, there was a positive, but negatively moderating, effect on financial performance. When the investigated enterprises attached higher importance to climate change issues and thus strengthened investments in, and implementation of, corresponding environmental performance indicators, the positive impact of environmental performance on financial performance gradually diminished to the point of negative impact, thereby affecting companies' operating profits. This was especially the case for private enterprises. However, disclosure of climate change-related risks and opportunities has a significant positive effect on financial performance among such firms. In addition, private firms and social performance indicators had a negative, but positively moderating, effect on financial performance. This meant that, upon investigation, the private enterprises made more effort to invest in and implement social performance indicators, and the impact on financial performance gradually increased and eventually shifted from negative to positive. Environmental performance indicators and financial performance were generally found to exhibit a distinctly positive effect. In summary, the results of this study can be used as a reference for firm managers to enhance their decision-making related to actions, strategies, and planning in response to climate change-related risks and opportunities under the framework of ESG performance indicators. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Moreover, by drawing on the institutional-based view, it was determined that government subsidies moderate the inverted U-shaped relationship between ESG and CFP. Specifically, we found that the inverted U-shaped effect of ESG on CFP is weakened when government subsidies are high.

Findings: The findings elicited from the empirical results demonstrate that there is no significant relationship between ESG and operational performance (ROA), financial performance (ROE) and market performance (TQ).

	abstract = {This study examines the impact of Digitalized Environmental, Social, and Governance (DESG) practices on rural banks in Ghana, focusing on their relationship with stakeholder engagement, customer loyalty, brand equity, and financial performance. The study collected data from 724 respondents, including bank customers and officials. The study finds that DESG practices directly and positively affect rural banks’ brand equity using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Additionally, stakeholder engagement indirectly and positively mediates the relationship between DESG and brand equity. Meanwhile, customer loyalty significantly mediates DESG and brand equity, and the combination of stakeholder engagement and customer loyalty jointly and significantly mediates the relationship between DESG and brand equity. Furthermore, DESG and brand equity indirectly and significantly impact rural banks’ financial performance during the study. These results underscore the essential role of digitalizing ESG practices in enhancing banks’ brand equity and overall performance. As a result, the study recommends that rural banks invest in digital infrastructure and platforms to enable effective stakeholder engagement, customer loyalty programs, and ESG reporting. © 2023 The Author(s).

In particular, in the context of frequent financial crises and COVID-19 pandemic, how the performance of listed companies' environmental, social, and governance (ESG) affects the company's market value has attracted widespread attention. Different from existing studies, this paper takes financial performance as a mediating variable and constructs linear regression model and mediating effect model based on analyzing the relationship between ESG performance, financial performance, and company market value and their influencing mechanism. The ESG rating data of Chinese listed companies newly developed by SynTao Green Finance from 2014 to 2019 were selected for empirical test. The results show that the improvement of ESG performance of listed companies can improve the market value of the company, and the financial performance of the company presents an obvious mediating effect. At the same time, operational capacity is an important mediating way for ESG performance to affect the company's market value. Further research shows that ESG performance of state-owned listed companies exerts a stronger mediating effect on corporate operating capacity. Finally, this paper provides relevant suggestions for regulators, listed companies, and investors. © 2022 The Authors.

The idea of socially responsible investing is commonly accepted in New Zealand, and past academic literature has argued for the positive (though often weak) relationship between companies’ stock returns and their ESG profile. The methodology of the research is threefold. First, the average daily return for 11 New Zealand Exchange (NZX) market sectors and the S&P/NZX50 index during the COVID-19 panic and rebound periods are compared. Then, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the average daily return of 11 broad NZX sectors in relation to the average ESG score for a given sector is checked. Finally, the relationship between the daily average performance of 56 NZX-listed companies and their ESG scores proxied by Refinitiv’s ESG Combined Score is determined. The analysis reveals no support for the idea that the returns of firms with higher ESG scores are greater than those with a low ESG ranking during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show a negative, though statistically insignificant, correlation between the ESG score and annualized stock return both on the sector and individual company levels. Even though our reported findings do not confirm the believed positive correlation of the analyzed measures (based on previous studies), they clearly show that high ESG performance does not harm financial performance even in the context of crises. © 2022 by the authors.},

The population was all listed companies in the SET. Using annual reports during 2015 to 2019, content analysis by word counting was used to quantify the level and pattern of ESG disclosure in corporate annual reports, while financial performance was measured by corporate net income. Descriptive analysis, independent sample t-test, correlationmatrix, and panel data analysis were used to analyze the data of this study. The results found that there was an increase of ESG disclosure in annual reporting during 2015 to 2019 by listed companies in the SET. The most common ESG disclosure was governance information disclosure following by social and environmental information disclosures. Moreover, there was the significantly positive relationship between ESG disclosure and corporate financial performance. Using control variables, stock reaction, firm age, firm risk, and ESG group had a positive correlation with corporate financial performance. The Findings can demonstrate that stakeholder theory can be used to explain the benefit of ESG disclosure, although the disclosure is still voluntary reporting in Thailand. © 2023 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

In their decision making, investors increasingly consider the non-financial performance of companies such as their social and environmental impact. However, the business research community has not yet reached a consensus regarding the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial performance. This research contributes to the discussion on this relationship. It does so by assessing the impact of the individual dimensions of the environmental, social and governance (ESG) score on the corporate financial performance of renewable energy firms from a quantitative and qualitative perspective. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) reveals complex and equifinal configurations that lead companies to record high and low levels of Tobin’s Q. The results for a sample of 96 energy companies from the Eikon database do not provide strong enough evidence to affirm that the individual dimensions of the ESG score have a decisive effect on the corporate financial performance of renewable energy firms. © 2023 The Author(s).

We also control for bank-specific, macroeconomic and governance effects. The findings pinpoint a negative relationship between ESG on one hand and operational performance (ROA), financial performance (ROE) and market performance (TQ) on the other hand.

This study aims to provide empirical findings to answer these issues by defining non-financial performance in terms of the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and COVID-19 pandemic to represent the crisis. Non-financial companies listed on stock exchanges in the Southeast Asia countries that are member of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) were selected as the samples for the research period of 2016–2020. The results show that the IC has a positive association with financial performance but a negative relationship with ESG performance. With the COVID-19 pandemic as the moderating variable, the results show that the pandemic period is not found to moderate the effect of the IC on financial performance and ESG performance. These results indicate that under normal conditions prior to the economic crisis caused by COVID-19, companies in Southeast Asia prioritised the use of IC to improve financial performance. Meanwhile, during the COVID-19 pandemic, companies in the region have not utilised IC to improve their financial and non-financial performance. The findings that IC affect ESG performance negatively need a serious attention amid the increasing awareness of sustainability and the expected role of corporate in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Through analytical methodologies like the two-stage least square method with instrumental variables (2SLS-IV) and the dynamic Generalised Method of Moments (GMM), we unveil an intriguing discovery: governance performance does not significantly correlate with idiosyncratic volatility, whereas environmental and social performance demonstrate a strong negative linkage. This deviation from conventional wisdom underscores our study’s unique contributions. We shed light on the governance factor’s discordance from its environmental and social counterparts in shaping firm-specific risk, introduce the emerging concept of board composition’s moderating effects on the ESG-volatility relationship, and present a holistic perspective by covering an extensive array of U.S. sectors. Our findings carry profound implications for the future trajectory of sustainable investing and corporate governance practices. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study was based on companies listed in the Forbes list of 100 most innovative companies and BCG’s 50 most innovative companies. The innovative sample firms had higher ESG and component scores than the matched control firms, with statistical significance. In terms of distinctiveness of governance, the innovative firms had larger boards, independent board members, higher diversity, and longer board tenure. Innovative firms had superior financial performance in comparison with the matched control firms. A logit regression model was employed to predict whether firms that adopt sustainability initiatives tend also to be innovative companies. Firms with high intensity of investment in social and governance initiatives tended to be innovative. Innovative firms had greater focus on social initiatives related to employee satisfaction, promotion of a healthy and safe workplace, and diversity. However, innovative firms tended to score lower in terms of human rights initiatives. Innovative firms provided superior governance practices for shareholders and effective usage of antitakeover defense mechanisms. Debt-intensive firms tended to be innovative. © 2023 by the author.},

This study aims to examine the ESG-based sustainability index and economic policy uncertainty (EPU). Design/methodology/approach: Corporate sustainability assessment procedure yields Dow Jones sustainability indexes (DJSIUS) and ESG compliant firms become a member of such indexes. To uncover the effects of policy uncertainty as follows: the study considers EPU index, equity market policy uncertainty index, economic and political events for the period 2000–2017. The authors present the study using a conditional volatility framework. Findings: The correlation between the DJSIUS and policy uncertainty appears to be negative and statistically significant. It is apparent from the results that policy uncertainty does contain important ESG factors that explain the sustainable investment in US firms. Moreover, the stock market boom, credit crunch, Lehman collapse and fiscal crises have shown significant adverse effects on the sustainability index. More importantly, it is seen that investors’ sustainable investing considers presidential election years for portfolio planning; the uncertainty associated with the election years has also shown a negative impact on the sustainable returns. Practical implications: First, sustainability is essential for the long-term stakeholders’ wealth maximization under governments’ policy uncertainty such as constrained resources, demographic and climate-change-policy, societal expectations, public-policies, regulatory structure. Second, EPU creates new opportunities and risks for sustainable firms and sustainable investing. Originality/value: The study is novel in which the authors present the effects of uncertainty on socially responsible investing. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper deliberately selected variables and composite methods for E, S and G and integrated them into the ESG index through learning from the western experience and Chinese actuality.

	abstract = {As the world transitions from a shareholder to a stakeholder economy, engineering managers at airports are becoming actively engaged in sustainable development that incorporates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) consequences into management. Unlike previous sustainability frameworks that focused on reporting in a single direction, the ESG framework encourages a standard approach to assessing non-financial performance so that stakeholders can evaluate and compare ESG across organizations. While there are several publications on sustainability, no single definition and metrics have been agreed upon due to its subjective nature and customization to the individual entity. Although the focus on sustainability may vary by industry, the water issue has received relatively little attention, particularly in the air transport sector. By examining airport sustainability reports, this article investigates airports' water sustainability. The airports included in the analysis are those that are part of the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems, participate in the Airport Sustainability Planning program, and have sustainability reporting documentation. Of the 30 large hub airports in the U.S., 12 airports participated in the Airport Sustainability Planning program, and of that, the researchers located sustainability, ESG or integrated annual reports for 8 airports. The findings have significance for offering a comprehensive definition of water sustainability, examination of goals, and suggested metrics that are applicable to other airports. As hub airports are similar to municipalities and have large physical plants with numerous engineering projects per year, these findings may be useful to engineering managers incorporating environmental sustainability in other large facilities.

Drawing upon the stakeholder theory and the natural resource-based view of the firm, this research uses firm-level Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) data of 462 companies across 7 Asian countries for the period 2015–2019 and employs time fixed-effects panel regression with country and industry dummies. We find that measures of innovation (i.e. conventional innovation and green innovation) are beneficial to the firm value. However, the positive effect of conventional innovation on the firm valuation builds at the expense of the environment since it poses a significant threat to environmental quality by positively contributing to carbon emission. Whilst firms’ investments in green innovation are advantageous to either type of firm performance. Further analysis shows that firms that focus on environmental practices generate significant outcomes, e.g. improved financial performance, suggesting that firms should prioritize their green investments to enhance the innovation outcomes so as to achieve superior financial value and to attract potential environmentally proactive stakeholders. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

We investigate 350 UK firms in the FTSE350 index from 2016 to 2021 with daily data on stock performance and annual data on financial performance. The empirical results show that firms with a high ESG disclosure score have a lower volatility of stock performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. For these firms, the negative relationship between stock performance, as well as financial performance, and their main driving factors, is lower during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among these factors, we identify the lockdown announcement, quantitative easing announcement, and the intensity of news media coverage of the company. These results tend to indicate that the quantity of ESG data reported by firms can contribute to mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stock performance volatility and financial performance. © 2023 Journal of Innovation Economics and Management.

Although the extant literature has focused on various aspects of sustainability, the impact of waste management, which has disastrous consequences for the climate and firm performance, remains largely unexplored. Thus, using the 2002–2019 data of listed firms from 41 countries, we found a significantly negative (positive) relationship between waste generation (recycling) and financial performance. Our findings are robust to alternative variables, sub-sample analysis, and identification strategies. Moreover, a channel analysis showed that this relationship is influenced by operating costs, ESG performance-based compensation, industry nature, the Paris agreement on climate change, and the global financial crisis. Overall, the findings suggest that environmental initiatives are beneficial for firms and present important policy implications for regulators and firms. © 2022},

For example, firms led by more masculine-faced CEOs have better financial performance (ROA) but are more likely to have a higher likelihood of financial misreporting. The harnessing of the strong achievement drive of masculine-faced CEOs to minimize potentially adverse corporate outcomes is of primary concern. We hypothesize that a well-designed environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practice could serve this purpose. Using a sample of South Korean public companies from 1998 to 2015, we find supporting evidence that a one-standard-deviation increase in fWHR is associated with a three-fold higher likelihood of corporate fraud and that the association is attenuated for firms with stronger ESG performance that includes voluntarily disclosing sustainability reports, holding less cash, and incentivizing with stock options. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

The ESG literature supports a positive correlation between a firm's ESG performance and its financial performance; however, the details of this relationship are ambiguous, which has led to conflicting results in the literature. This article asserts that this ambiguity is largely related to the fact that ESG studies rarely consider the important issue of materiality. This article is an expanded replication of analysis by Williams & Apollonio (2022), a study that called for deeper analysis of both materiality and the causal link between ESG ratings and financial performance. Design / Methodology / Approach. This methodology calculates Pearson Correlation coefficients between Bloomberg ESG scores and abnormal returns for S & P 500 firms from 2020 to 2022 after controlling for the material issue of GICS sectors. Findings. The results show no relationship between ESG scores and abnormal returns, and the conclusion is that controlling for GICS sectors is not the methodology that will clarify the presumed positive correlation between ESG performance and financial performance. Originality / Value / Practical implications. This study is one of the few that addresses materiality in ESG ratings. The finding that controlling for GICS sectors does not sufficiently control for materiality is a significant building block for future researchers. This article suggests that more granular categorization of sub-industries using a larger sample than the S & P 500 is likely to be useful future research.  © 2022 Zach Williams, published by Sciendo.},

Using legitimacy theory, we first examine two compelling questions: (1) What legitimate firm practices support ESG performance? and (2) Does ESG performance directly lead to firm financial performance? As firms redefine their aims and pivot to ESG conduct, stakeholders are becoming increasingly concerned about the rising incidence of greenwashing. We examine two additional questions: (3) Is there a link between ESG performance and greenwashing? and (4) How does greenwashing affect firm financial performance? We find that stakeholder legitimacy is an antecedent to ESG performance and financial performance.

Specifically, this study aims to analyse the effect of sustainable practices on firms' stock returns during and after the first COVID-19 pandemic emergency. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative study was conducted to determine the impact of sustainable practices on firms' stock returns, using a sample of 1,418 European listed firms. In particular, we tested the effect of environmental (E) and social (S) scores, providing a multi-sectoral analysis in order to consider sector specificities. Findings: The empirical outcomes indicate the existence of a negative (weak) or null relationship between sustainable practices and stock returns, failing to provide evidence that these practices are able to protect shareholders value during times of crisis. Practical implications: The results obtained made it possible to highlight significant implications for investors and practitioners. They may have particular attention in evaluating firm's sustainable practices trying to understand more precisely the value that such practices can have for the company and its shareholders.

The approach of the research involves qualitative content analysis of sustainability reports in order to determine disclosure levels, and statistical methods such as t-tests of differences in means to draw conclusions on the differences in disclosure levels based on diversity parameters. The results of the study demonstrate that ESG disclosure scores have improved over time. The average ESG disclosure score increased from 40% in the 2020 sample to 47% in the 2022 sample, with this improvement largely driven by an increase in the disclosure of corporate governance topics. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that companies with female board members and larger boards tend to achieve higher ESG transparency levels. The results show that companies with female members on their boards have higher ESG disclosure levels, with an average of 54% for companies with female members on their management boards compared to 42% for those without, and an average disclosure level of 52% for companies with gender-diverse supervisory boards compared to 42% for those with all-male supervisory board members. The findings of this study contribute to the academic literature by shedding light on the differences in ESG disclosure levels during a time of heightened corporate sustainability awareness, as well as connecting diversity to corporate sustainability. © 2023 Mykolo Romerio Universitetas.

Using a unique data set, we find that limited partners (LPs) are motivated to incorporate ESG because they believe that ESG usage is more strongly correlated with financial performance. We find that general partners (GPs) are motivated to integrate ESG factors into their investment strategies in response to increased client demand for sustainable products. Furthermore, we find that private equity (PE) uses ESG factors more intensely than venture capital (VC) regardless of geography. We also find that PE firms use voice and exit strategies more extensively than VC funds in efforts to promote ESG activities in companies. When evaluating individual components of ESG scores, we find that the investors consider the governance score the most important component, followed by E, and then S. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this research was to analyze the relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility and companies' financial performance, from the perspective of ESG scores. Theoretical framework: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and social and financial performance were conceptualized. The Legitimacy Theory consolidates CSR as a social contract, established between the company and society through actions that will be evaluated by their development and the results disclosed (Guthrie & Parker, 1989). Corporate social performance (DSC) represents the way in which the company meets and responds to the demands of social content, generating collective results (Boaventura, Silva & Bandeira-de-Melo, 2012). Method: Explanatory, documentary and quantitative research with a sample composed of companies that are part of the BRICS and that made ESG scores available, from 2018 to 2022, through Thomson Reuters Eikon®. Results and conclusion: The results confirm that there is a positive and significant relationship only for market performance when analyzing the RSCENV variable (CSR Environmental). The variable RSCGOV (CSR Governance) presented a non-significant result. Research implications: The results show that the hypothesis tested that corporate social responsibility strategies have a positive relationship with financial performance was disregarded by the research data. Originality/value: This study contributes to deepening the discussion about the impact of Corporate Social Responsibility practices on the performance of organizations, specifically aiming to contribute to the analysis of the impact of different aspects of sustainability (Environmental, Social and Governance) on operational and market performance. © 2023 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

The continued flatlining of ESG reporting quality has led some parties to call on policy-makers to take advantage of the distinct contextual pressure from external stakeholders to improve corporate ESG commitments. However, the relationship between external stakeholders and ESG disclosure remains am-biguous, both theoretically and empirically. Grounded in stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, resource-based theory, and slack resource theory, this article reconcep-tualizes Ullmann’s 1985 model of corporate social performance to present a novel conceptual framework to examine the external stakeholders-ESG disclosure re-lationship. This article contributes to the literature by illustrating the mediating effect of the strategic posture and the moderating effect of corporate financial performance on corporate ESG discourse perpetuated by powerful stakeholders. © 2023 by the authors.},

GR-OPS is quantified as an inverse of the energy intensity (ene-int) of the firm’s operations. CFP is proxied by return on equity and return on assets. The study uses panel data for non-financial firms listed on India’s Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) 100 index. The ESG-sensitive firms are bifurcated from a broader list of BSE 100 index based on their belongingness to the BSE ESG 100 index for econometric analysis. The findings confirm that the impact of GR-OPS on CFP is subject to the firms’ adherence to ESG practices. A positive relationship between GR-OPS and CFP is established for ESG-sensitive firms, while the linkage is non-existent for non-ESG firms. Such findings are attributable to ESG sensitivity (reduced risks) and not the reduced operational costs due to reduced ene-int. The study claims that the benefits of ESG are evident via GR-OPS. Firms should attempt to meet ESG practices to unlock the financial benefits of GR-OPS. When coupled, these practices can reduce the overall risk of the firms as well as generate better economic profits. Adherence to ESG practices and GR-OPS will build environmentally and socially sensitive firms. This is a greater need of modern society, which is increasingly fighting social unrest, global health concerns and climate change. © 2023 MDI.},

In addition, we examine the moderating effect of state-ownership on the FP-ESG relationship. Based on data collected from 36 airlines worldwide for the period 2008–2019, we found that ESG is negatively and significantly influenced by FP. This result implies that the willingness of airlines to contribute to ESG initiatives is diminished when economic conditions are favorable. State-ownership moderates the relationship between FP and ESG such that the negative relationship is weaker in presence of state shares. Our findings help to disentangle the roles of FP in its contribution to sustainability and are valuable in better understanding the topic in airline context. Also, our results have some important implications for how industry practitioners may act more effectively in the managerial social decision process and provide insights to assist investors who are considering eco-investing in the airline industry. © 2022 Rovira i Virgili University.

	abstract = {In the last three decades researchers and professionals have given increasing attention to the question whether implementing environmentally friendly technologies, in other words, a move towards cleaner production is just a necessary response to social pressure, or a reasonable investment making measurable positive effects on the firm’s profitability. While in the 1990s the international literature served with mixed results, after the millennium, and especially in the 2010s and 2020s, research results have undoubtedly confirmed that the significance of improving environmental performance is far more than a responsibility for the planet, but it obviously boosts financial performance. This direction of causality has dominated the literature so much that it was almost never raised that the effect can also be reverse, and mainly those companies that have a strong financial background are able to become leaders in cleaner production. This study focuses on this research gap, and based on data of 288 international large companies authors document that firms with strong financials are much more likely to reach a high level of environmental performance, and this relationship is stronger in case of manufacturing companies than for servicing companies. Based on these results, it can be concluded that a good financial position is not just a consequence, but also a criterion for going green. © 2023, Statisztikai Szemle. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of sustainable business models in building corporate reputation and resilience. Specifically, the financial performance of listed companies will be evaluated following the beginning of the armed conflict in Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Taking as a standpoint the triple bottom line (TBL) theory, the case of firms listed in the Spanish IBEX-35 index is analysed. The present paper evaluates financial performance and corporate reputation, based on the usage of Environment, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) strategies to adhere to their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this goal, energy firms operating in Spain are evaluated. Specifically, companies operating in the energy sector listed in the IBEX35, benchmark index of Spain’s largest trading platform are considered. The analysis comprises evaluating the fluctuation in the value of their stock and the influence of usage of renewable and other power sources that limit dependency on foreign events. In addition, communication and dissemination of non-financial information, and usage of international standards within these areas, are considered as well. Findings: Results show long-term CSR commitments and ESG strategies significantly impact firm’s ability to overcome crises and improve financial performance. Additionally, energy firms that adhered to the energy transition into renewables display stronger performance and lower dependency on uncertain and weakened markets during the Ukraine armed conflict. Practical implications: The results contribute to the advancement of the TBL theory and the creation of sustainable business models. By introducing ESG strategies, firms are able to improve the people-profit-planet balance and at the same time improve their resilience. This contributes to an overall enhancement of their capacity to overcome crises and sustain their financial performance and corporate reputation over time. Policy makers can also benefit from this knowledge, introducing regulation that promotes and supports companies’ development of their CSR through ESG strategies, to ensure more sustainable organisations that can support the economy in a context of hardship. Originality/value: The analysis evaluates the results of a firm’s long-term commitment to the TBL through adequate ESG strategies when operating in unexpected and unprecedented hostile environments. Previous research has focused on the link between some variables concerning financial performance and ESG strategies yet not considering the specific context of an enhanced crisis (i.e. a pandemic and armed conflict). This can provide significant insight into the contribution that people, profit and planet can provide in building sustainable and successful organisations. Lastly, the paper outlines the key factors that contributed to the firm’s ability to overcome extreme hardships, such as operating in an environment affected by a combination of two crises. © 2022, Marina Mattera and Federico Soto.},

Previous research mainly examines the impact of ESG information disclosure on firm value and other financial indicators, but little research has focused on the effect of carbon information on brand value. This paper focuses on the influence of corporate carbon information disclosure on brand value, and we find that it positively impacts corporate brand value. In addition, when a company chooses to adopt a more quantitative and diverse carbon information strategy, it increases its brand value. We also examine the potential mechanisms involved in how corporate carbon information disclosure influences brand value. We focus on three types of factor: analyst rating, customer attitude, and corporate financial performance, and find that higher analyst forecasts and positive customer attitudes have a positive impact on the association between the carbon information strategy and corporate brand value. In contrast, corporate financial performance provides only weak evidence. These results are consistent with demands by users for more precise guidelines from regulators and standard-setters for measuring and disclosing carbon-related information. © 2023 by the authors.},

The empirical analysis of this study concluded that the effect of CSR on corporate financial performance has different results in different industries, the effect of CSR on CFP is significant and negative in the healthcare industry and insignificant in the financial industry. However, there are some limitations to this study. The study only considered the financial sector and the healthcare sector and was not able to include a number of other sectors for comparison.

We examine shareholders-sponsored corporate socially responsible (CSR) proposals related to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) that are voted to pass or fail by a small margin. The adoption of those “close call” proposals is regarded as equivalent to a random assignment of CSR policies and, therefore, provides a quasi-experimental setting to capture the causal influence of CSR on firm performance. We apply the regression discontinuity design (RDD) and find that CSR proposals’ passage leads to a significant positive abnormal return on the voting day. The results are robust with both parametric and nonparametric approaches of RDD and different polynomial orders. However, we fail to identify a significant change in financial performance in the long-term. One possible reason is that passing a CSR proposal could be symbolic, rather than substantial. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Prior studies articulate the growing synergy between Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies and CE techniques. However, the literature lacks empirical evidence regarding boardrooms' commitment to implementing these technological domains through sustainable strategic investment decision-making practices (SSIDMP). This paper uses computer-aided textual analysis to explore the current trend of SSIDMP in UK companies. Our debate draws on data from UK companies, FTSEE ALL Share, over the period (2012−2021). We develop proxies for I4.0 technologies and CE techniques to examine the synergy between I4.0 technologies and CE techniques and the influence of this synergy on companies' financial performance. The findings reveal the vital role the organizational ambidexterity plays in the synergy between I4.0 technologies and CE techniques through exploring and exploiting technological techniques and mechanisms to cope with changing business environment. Our empirical study explores the impact of governance mechanisms on the relationships between SSIDMP, I4.0 technologies, CE techniques, and companies' financial performance. Findings support that synergy between these two domains is the key determinant of sustainable value creation and sustainable organizational performance. The synergy between I4.0 technologies and CE techniques significantly impact SSIDMP and companies' financial performance, though the level of the synergy varies according to industry sectors. Furthermore, our analysis shows that governance mechanisms (ESG, board compositions, risk management, internal audit) strengthen the relationships between these two domains and companies' performance. © 2022},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effect of environmental, social and governance (ESG) controversies on the cost of equity (COE) capital, exploring the moderating role of both positive ESG performance and market securities regulation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a sample of 2,599 time observations related to European listed companies for which the authors examine a set of 30 negative ESG scores across the three pillars in terms of controversies, compliance and other negative issues. This study uses the average of seven implied COE estimates. Findings: The results show that negative ESG performance, particularly environmental controversies, increases the COE, although this impact is mitigated when associated with company efforts to improve environmental performance. Besides, environmental controversies are likely to increase the COE in countries where the market regulation is stronger, as a consequence of higher investors’ expectations towards the scrutiny role of more efficient markets against companies’ controversies. Practical implications: Companies should take care seriously of environmental issues such as biodiversity, product impact and resource impact, because investors do react accordingly. As despite no direct effects of positive ESG performance are observed in terms of COE reduction, the mitigating role on the ESG controversies–COE relationship makes ESG practices still significant for European investors. Social implications: The effects of ESG performance on company financial performance should be investigated under the assumption that bad events weight more than positive ESG performance. Originality/value: Because no prior studies have specifically assessed the effect of the European listed companies’ ESG controversies on their COE, this paper delivers insights into the relationship between positive and negative ESG performance and their effects on capital market financing. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The conventional view of regulation is that it exists to constrain corporate activity that harms the public. But amid perceptions of government failure, many now call on corporations to tackle social problems themselves. And in this moment of dissatisfaction with government, powerful asset managers have stepped in to serve as regulators of last resort, adopting rules that bind corporate America on issues of great social importance, including climate change and workplace diversity. This Article describes this dynamic—where shareholders have become regulators—which has been made possible by the rise of institutional shareholding (and index investing in particular) and the contemporaneous growth of shareholder power. As a result, the large diversified asset managers that specialize in index funds (the so-called “Big Three”—Vanguard, State Street, and BlackRock) collectively hold nearly controlling stakes across the public equity market. In addition to intervening in traditional areas of corporate governance, they have adopted sweeping board diversity mandates as well as “ESG” disclosure and carbon emission reduction requirements, and enforced them through their proxy voting policies. And the early consensus is that asset managers have been influential in these areas, driving change where other private (and public) efforts failed. This Article describes these regulatory interventions in detail and concludes that we are witnessing a novel privatization dynamic. It also offers a theory about the incentives that shape it. Asset managers will only supply regulation if it has a positive impact on their profits; therefore, demand from clients—which include not just individuals, but also institutions—will govern the choice of policies and the substance of their rules. And given the breadth of the Big Three’s clientele and their interest in avoiding government backlash, their policies are likely to take many interests into account. Nonetheless, serious concerns loom large, including the fact that for-profit asset managers lack democratic accountability and government oversight for their policymaking, with no guarantee that it will further the public interest. To the extent that their policies are shaped by the corporate clients that provide much of the assets they manage, they are unlikely to be as impactful as many perceive. The provision of regulation by asset managers may also take pressure off the government to respond to these issues with policies better calibrated toward advancing social welfare. At bottom, understanding the forces that shape (and potential problems that accompany) this privatization dynamic is of critical importance not just for investors and corporations, but also for the public. © 2023 University of Pennsylvania Law School.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The influence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors on financial performance has been confirmed in the literature. The article aims to examine the relationship between financial and non-financial factors in enterprises and to indicate for which groups of enterprises the relationship of ESG and financial performance is most visible in the context of building sustainable business models and the ability to adapt to sustainability. The article assumes that enterprises’ financial and non-financial results determine their adaptability to sustainability, and there is a relationship between financial results, non-financial performance, and companies’ sustainable business models. METHODOLOGY: The analysis encompasses 11 EU countries in the period 2008–2020. The study analyzed 6,864 observations, that is, 96,096 data cells. The data are divided into two groups of variables: financial and non-financial. The research is based on clusters analysis and ANOVA. It was carried out in two stages. In the first step, enterprises were grouped into clusters according to the financial condition criterion, considering the enterprise’s size and sector and country in which it operates. In the next step, it was checked whether enterprises with good financial standing also achieve better non-financial results. FINDINGS: It was found that large enterprises achieve better financial results than small and medium-sized enterprises, even though they operate in the same location and sectors. It can be emphasized there are statistical differences between entities with relatively good financial conditions and those with relatively weaker financial conditions in the context of such values as gender employment gap, total population living in households considering that they suffer from noise, greenhouse gas emission, Corruption Perceptions Index. The companies with relatively better financial standing achieve a smaller gender employment gap (at the national level) than entities with relatively worse financial conditions. It is similar to referring to the greenhouse gas (GHG) level. IMPLICATIONS: The results of this study may be useful for managements of companies in developing strategies of transformation towards sustainability, thanks to the fact that they provide information on what factors should be taken into account in the transformation process. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: The originality of this study lies in the fact that it takes into account both financial and non-financial factors and examines the relationships between these factors in the process of companies’ adaptation towards sustainability and sustainable business model. © 2023, Cognitione Foundation for the Dissemination of Knowledge and Science.

We test the effect of ESG and its quadratic term on FP by controlling for bank-specific, macroeconomic and financial development variables. Our results support the presence of a non-linear ESG–FP relationship. ESG incremental investments remain beneficial till reaching an inflection point. Interestingly, the financial development variables are significant, while ESG pillars follow different patterns. Governance pillar has a concave relationship with accounting performance while environmental pillar has a convex relationship with the market return. The ESG–FP relationship depends on three vectors: pillars; measure of FP; and level of ESG. Banks should determine ESG turning points to rationalize their investments and contemplate efficient returns. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The research paper uses two-stage least square model and the study covered the five-year period 2015–2019. Findings: Banks with high intensity of social and governance-related activities have positive market-based valuation effects. Adequately capitalized banks tend to invest more in social initiatives. Banks' governance initiatives directed toward the use of anti-takeover defensive mechanisms are skeptically perceived by markets. Riskier banks tend to have less investments in social initiatives. Research limitations/implications: The findings are relevant in the context of expectations from policymakers, consumers and investors with respect to the role which banks ought to play in funding the development of a sustainable economy. The research finding that strong governance and social initiatives by banks are value-enhancing measures is a clear evidence of the significance of ESG initiatives as value-creating mechanisms as perceived by markets.

Firm size is a moderator in the relationship of financial crisis and ESG performance of the firm. Further findings of the study explain that ESG, firm size and CG are the moderators in the relationship of GFC and firm financial performance.

This paper empirically investigated the impact of ESG on the performance of banks in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region by collecting and analyzing the data of 29 banks located in the six GCC countries — namely the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. It studies data for the period 2010–2022 collected from the Refinitiv Eikon platform. Applying the ordinary least squares (OLS) and panel regression (fixed and random effect) techniques, it examines the impact of ESG on the performance of these banks. The significant Hausman test favored using the fixed effect results. The results suggest that a bank‘s size positively influences its performance. The larger the bank the more diverse its ESG activities and the better its performance. Additionally, ESG and asset quality have a significant negative correlation to performance, implying a lower asset quality indicates higher loan loss provision and leads to lower financial performance. Finally, the results also suggest banks are overinvesting in ESG to comply with the latest standards set by investors and regulators. © 2023 by Authors.},

	abstract = {Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities have become essential and viable activities of corporations because of the increase in concern for environmental, social, and governance issues. The motive of this research is to measure the effect of ESG on the financial performance (FP) of healthcare corporations using the market-to-book value (MTB) ratio as a proxy of FP. A sample of 33 pharma companies in India from 2011 to 2020 has been considered. The study relies on the panel data method to assess the association between ESG and FP. The potential moderating role of competition has also been studied to simplify their relationship in this framework. The finding of this study is that there is a significant negative association between ESG and FP, and it is also found that when competition is used as a moderator, it results in a significantly positive impact on the ESG and FP of healthcare companies. This study increases the understanding of the association between ESG and FP and helps corporations to formulate corporate strategies and stakeholders to make investment decisions. The originality of this study is that it addresses the impact of competition on ESG and FP of the healthcare industry and will become foundational literature for future studies. © 2023 by the authors.},

The study focused on the financial and non-financial metrics of the top global energy firms from 2006 to 2018 to accomplish this objective. It employed an estimated generalized least square method on the balanced panel of 3211 firm-year observations. The findings assert the existence of a curvilinear relationship by spurning the linearity assumption. Further, results revealed a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between CSPR and CFP. In addition to this, the investigation reveals that this relationship exists with the environmental and social attributes of CSPR. While the governance attribute was initially insignificant, however, it also exhibits a significant inverted-U relationship after interacting with earnings. As a result, it adds to the existing literature by identifying earnings as a significant moderator in explaining the curvilinear relationship between CSPR and CFP. The inverted U-shaped relationship may assist top management in developing a sustainable social and environmental policy based on a reactive strategy and help in formulating strategies to balance the value-cost trade-off for sustainable development. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

With the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, institutional investors are shifting their focus from profit-making to sustainable and ethical investment. Investors are majorly focussing on ESG measures with financial incentives while making investment decisions. Empirical evidences indicate that firms disclosing ESG measures are likely to outperform others by reducing the risk and enhancing the economic performance, although the results may vary. ESG measures not only promote economic incentives but also encourage sustainable production through value accretive supply chain mechanism. The present study tries to explore the ESG disclosure-Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) nexus w.r.t the presence of sustainable value chains, considering the panel data of 1,170 firm-level observations from 2012 to 2020. In order to resolve endogeneity issue, we use Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) and system GMM approach.

This study controls for firm-level variables (leverage, size and loss), macroeconomic variables (COVID, gross domestic product and inflation) and institutional variables. Findings: Findings indicate that countries with different levels of disclosure exhibit different patterns. Distinctly, the environmental pillar has a concave impact on return on assets, and the role of the disclosure index greatly manifests with the environmental pillar. Practical implications: This study ponders the impact of country disclosure on sustainability practices from a global health-care perspective.

Our analysis investigates board diversity in terms of board attributes (board size, board age, board gender diversity, board independence and CSR (corporate social responsibility/sustainability committee) and measures ESG dimensions by using the ESG score provided by the Refinitiv database hosted by Thomson Reuters. The main empirical results reveal that the board size, board independence and the presence of a CSR/sustainability committee positively influence a bank’s ESG performance while no significant relationship between board average age and ESG performance is found. Additionally, the relationship between gender-balanced boards and ESG performance is positive but the impact of female directors on ESG performance is non-linear when a critical mass of women is reached. This paper comprises an in-depth inspection of the corporate governance (CG) in banks, since in Italy there is limited literature concerning diversity in BoDs despite the relevance of the topic. This study is the first that examines the impact of specific CG characteristics (board diversity) on ESG performance in the Italian banking sector, to date. The investigation is highly relevant to managers and investors considering ESG issues in their decision-making process. In addition, findings have implications for both regulators and practitioners, suggesting that policymakers and managers should pay more attention to corporate governance aspects to enhance ESG performance. © 2022 by the authors.},

On the contrary, high power distance, collectivism (low individualism), feminine, low uncertainty avoidance, short-term orientation, and restraint dimensions would be expected to weaken a firm's financial performance by discouraging firms from undertaking superior environmental, social, governance performance. GLOBE's findings such as low power distance, collectivistic institutional and in-group national culture, high uncertainty avoidance, future orientation, all report a significant positive moderation impact on a firm's environmental, social, governance performance to strengthen its financial performance further. However, high gender-egalitarian national culture and high assertiveness would negatively moderate firm's financial performance and environmental, social, governance performance.

Conversely, the market sentiment effect is mixed as it positively influences Tobin's Q but negatively influences the return on assets (ROA). The impact of CSP, measured by environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores, on FP is similar to that of market sentiment. Specifically, we find that an effective ESG performance in the prior year, both the overall performance and the performance of the individual aspects, can escalate firm value but diminish firm profitability in the following year.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the linear and non-linear impact of CSR initiatives, disaggregated into three sets of dimensions; environment, social, and governance (ESG), and their interaction effects with economic growth on short and long-term financial performance across SP-500 non-financial companies, and further separated into manufacturing and service sectors in the USA. We estimated a dynamic panel data model, using the System Generalized Method of Moments (SYS-GMM) technique on a final sample of 281 companies and a total of 2,829 observations from 2010 to 2019. The result showed that social and governance dimensions of ESG influence companies’ financial performance across the two measures of a firm's financial performance (ROA and Tobin's Q), while environmental dimension is significant with the Tobin's Q measure. The overall result indicated that ESG disclosure practices significantly impact corporate financial performance both directly and indirectly. In addition, our findings reported that economic conditions positively moderate the effects of different ESG disclosure practices on financial performance. The results found provide firm-level decision-makers with insight into the nature of the financial implications exerted by ESG disclosure and the role that economic conditions play in determining the magnitude of these effects. Finally, the industry/sector results indicate that the service sector is also very sensitive to environmental information disclosure therefore, managers in this sector should pay attention to environmental issues and disclosure as air and chemical pollution may not be all as it relates to the environment. The general interpretation and key conclusion are that ESG information disclosure does enhance corporate financial performance in the SP-500 index, in times of both normality and financial/socioeconomic crisis, which has significant meaning for investors, company management, policy makers, and industry regulators. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This study uses a sample of non-financial listed companies from 2000 to 2020 and applies the staggered difference-in-differences technique to eliminate the endogeneity problem. Findings show that ESG disclosure has a favorable effect on corporate financial performance. This conclusion remains robust after a series of robustness tests, including the parallel trend test, Goodman-Bacon decomposition, replacement of dependent variables, system GMM estimate, the placebo test, etc. ESG disclosure has heterogeneous effects on financial performance. The positive effect of ESG disclosure on corporate financial performance is more pronounced in companies with ESG investors and companies with longer inception, high media attention, and high agency costs. In addition, investors with ESG preferences exert a substantial moderating effect on the link between ESG disclosure and financial performance connection. We arrive at two conclusions in the extended analysis. One is that ESG disclosure attracts ESG investors. Another is that ESG investors also play a positive moderating role in the connection between ESG ratings and financial performance. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, investors seek beyond the financial performance of their investments, including Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria in the decision-making process. To this effect, there are currently suppliers who offer different methodologies to evaluate the ESG factors that companies apply in their businesses. In 2016, Morningstar launched the Morningstar Sustainability Rating for mutual funds, which provides information on how well mutual funds incorporate sustainable assets. This rating is obtained from the Morningstar Portfolio Sustainability Score, the calculation system of which was modified and improved in 2018. However, an important drawback remains to be overcome because the score is only calculated if at least 67% of the portfolio assets have an ESG score and it does not take assets without an ESG score into account. This paper aims to provide a more reliable rating for investors because it proposes the inclusion of all the assets in the fund valuation, regardless of whether they have an ESG score, using fuzzy set theory and specifically triangular fuzzy numbers. © 2022 The Authors},

A quasi-experimental difference-in-differences (DID) design and a panel data are estimated to examine the impact of ESG scores and ESG combined scores on firms' stock return before and during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The results suggest that sustainable actions during the pandemic lessened stock returns, as evidenced by the negative coefficients of the ESGC and ESG scores. The interaction terms with firm size, revealed that ESGC and ESG scores had a positive relationship with stock returns during the pandemic. Thus, larger firms' returns benefited from higher ESG scores during the COVID-19 crisis.

The data were collected from the annual reports of selected banks for the pre-COVID-19 period (2018) and the COVID-19 period (2020). Results of the t-test show that there is a significant difference in ESG disclosures between the pre and during-COVID-19 periods. The regression analysis shows that the formative ESG factor positively affected the financial performance of the banking industry during the pre-COVID-19 period. While the reflective factors (environmental and social) positively affected the financial performance of the banking industry in the pre-COVID-19 period. During the COVID-19 period, the formative factor of ESG was found to have a significant positive impact on the financial performance of the banking industry. Similarly, in this period, the reflective factors (social and governance) were also found to have a significant positive impact on the financial performance of the banking industry. Interestingly, environmental sustainability negatively impacted the financial performance during the COVID-19 period. It indicates that the banking industry ignored environmental sustainability practices during the COVID −19 period, negatively affecting their financial performance. It suggests that ignoring environmental sustainability practices will deteriorate financial performance following the COVID-19 period. These results have profound policy implications for practitioners and policymakers in the banking industry, which are discussed. © 2023 The Author(s).

In particular, we examine how market capitalization, price to book value, Sharpe ratio and ESG score of large-cap firms in Europe are related to their stock performance. We consider a panel data consisting of six European countries—Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain, France and Germany—for the period 2010–2020. For Greek and French firms, a firm’s size tends to negatively affect its stock returns. The investors in European countries (except Italy) do not jeopardize their returns by investing in highly ESG scoring firms. We argue that the benefit of not investing in highly ESG-scoring firms might lead investors to select smaller size companies with a higher price to book value and higher Sharpe ratio, as it is more likely to generate higher returns. Moreover, Italian firms are more susceptible to ESG issues, as ESG performance and stock return seem to have a significant negative correlation. This valuable result was confirmed by conducting a robustness test for Europe as a whole using the Euronext100 index. Finally, we find no evidence that ESG motivates herding in our selected sample (this is not the case for Greece and France), while we report evidence of ESG herding behavior during the Covid-19 outbreak in Portugal, Italy and Greece. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Institutional investors play a crucial role in a firm’s operation and exert considerable influence on the efficient monitoring of innovative investment. Theory predicts that institutional ownership has a positive effect on innovation investment. However, we find that active institutional investors drove this positive relationship. For those passive institutional investors, this impact is negative. However, a banker on the board can change the effect from negative to positive for passive institutional investors. Firms with female directors, a high presence of audit committee, or a large proportion of ethnic minority directors on board have a significant and positive impact on innovation, including R&D investments and the number of patents. The enactment of Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002 made information more transparent to investors and narrowed the gap between active and passive institutional investors on innovation.

In the midst of this change, institutional shareholders declare and adopt socially responsible investment procedures, which is a way of engaging in investor activism. Despite the growing interest in investor activism following the introduction of the stewardship code, little attention has been paid to how socially responsible investment practices of institutional investors affect the non-financial value of the pillars of environmental, social, and governance as well as financial performance, including short-term accounting (ROE, ROA) and long-term market performance (Tobin q). The current study examines whether the national pension fund (NPF), the world’s third-largest Korean pension fund, can increase the ESG performance of investee firms in addition to accounting and market performance through institutional investors’ shareholding. This study, by applying path analysis, attempts to explore the relationship between the NPF’s socially responsible investing, ESG, and the financial performance of the investee firms. This research offers evidence that ESG performance acts as a moderator or a mediator between NPF’s shareholding and financial performance. © 2022 by the authors.},

For the data of a-share companies from 2010 to 2020, a multiple linear regression equation was constructed to test the impact of ESG performance on corporate financial performance. Although enterprises have spent huge costs in the process of ESG practice to fulfill their social responsibilities, they need to strengthen their links with stakeholders, improve their management level, practice environmental protection, and enable enterprises to gain a competitive advantage, thereby improving their ability to create value.

Design/methodology/approach: To test the current study hypotheses, the authors applied linear regressions with a panel data using the Thomson Reuters ASSET4 and Bloomberg database from a sample of 115 UK and 90 Germany companies selected from the ESG index over the period 2005–2019. Findings: The results show that the strengths ESG increase the firm value and the weaknesses decrease it. In addition, the authors find that green innovation fully mediates the relationship between ESG practices and financial performance in UK and Germany. Practical implications: The findings provide interesting implications to academics practitioners and regulators who are interested in discovering ESG score, financial performance and green innovation. The results also provide insights to regulators and the board of directors on future growth opportunities for the company and the country.

	abstract = {Studying Corporate Environmental, Social and Governance responsibility (ESG) and its consequences remain a topical concern of the company’s stakeholders including governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors and researchers over the past few decades. While most research has studied and validated the beneficial effect of ESG on financial performance. The few studies that have explored the nexus between financial performance and ESG relationship are conducted in a double causality framework. Thus, this research fills this gap by studying the effect of financial performance on ESG. Using a random-effects panel data model for more than 10,000 firm-year observations of 504 U.S. firms during the period 2000–2020, the results show a positive relationship between financial performance and ESG. Furthermore, cash holding, minority interest and inflation have significantly the expected sign. Yet, the market-to-book value seems insignificant. Interestingly, during periods of high economic policy uncertainty, oil price uncertainty and leverage, the impact of companies’ financial performance on ESG decreases differently according to the three components of the ESG. These findings are robust and consistent with alternative econometric specifications and alternative measures of dependent variable and control variables. © 2022 The Author(s).

Thus, to find out whether the term sustainability is more than just a label, we analyze the inclusion and exclusion criteria applied by sustainability indices, and we compare them with those applied by conventional indices. We analyze the level of sustainability and size of the companies included in and excluded from five sustainability indices compared to a control group of 11 conventional indices. Our results show that the level of sustainability influences the inclusion process and, to a lesser extent, the exclusion process of the five FTSE4Good indices. However, we find similar results for several conventional indices. In addition, the size criterion dominates the sustainability criterion in the inclusion and exclusion processes of sustainability indices like in conventional indices. Further, we use different cluster algorithms to determine that the inclusion and exclusion processes of four of the five sustainability indices are different from those of the conventional indices. Our results validate the use of the “sustainability” label for four of five sustainability indices but also show that further differentiation between sustainability and conventional indices is needed. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {ESG management has become the most prominent topic this year as the worldwide business environment of companies changes. ESG management is not an option to raise a company’s reputation but a factor that significantly affects corporate sustainability and corporate value in the long run as well as can be seen as an essential requirement for a company’s survival. As this trend is essential in evaluating corporate sustainability, ESG management is an inevitable global issue. This study aims to develop an index for ESG, a key indicator of corporate sustainability, targeting 49 companies that issue ‘sustainability reports’ among the top 150 asset-ranked companies. In addition, companies were divided into high and low groups based on the ESG index, and each group attempted to study the effect of economic responsibility among corporate social responsibility on financial performance. As a result, out of 49 companies, the high group was divided into 17 companies, and the low group was split into 14 companies. It was found that only the low group had a significantly positive (+) effect on the relationship between corporate economic responsibility and financial performance. This study can be used as a reference data for ESG research by developing an ESG index related to corporate sustainability. It is meaningful to confirm the management paradigm for corporate social responsibility and the importance of financial performance through comparison. © 2022 by the authors.

Particularly, the link that seems to exist between female directors and sustainable finance has received limited attention. We investigate the impact of an enhancement in female presence, meant as women in decision-making positions, on a firm’s performance both in financial and sustainability terms. The goal is to contribute to the literature streams on gender economics and on sustainable finance. Most research on sustainable finance and its impact on corporate governance rely only on aggregate ESG ratings for their results. Such scores are typically a black-box, with financial providers supplying little information about their methodology. Our analysis not only develops disaggregate scores for each dimension, but also provides motivation for the measurement of gender equality by means of specific indicators, such as the number of female directors, going beyond the bare (S) or (G) rating. ESG ratings and specific indicators of gender equality were retrieved from the well-known Bloomberg provider. Relying on a dataset concerning European companies, we empirically show that an increase in gender equality has a positive effect on a firm’s financial performance and on its share of sustainable investments. © 2022 Costanza Bosone, Stefania Maria Bogliardi and Paolo Giudici.},

Using ANOVA and multivariate regression models, we analyze the differences and relationship between the financial returns of ETFs and their Eco-fund ratings during the COVID-19 pandemic-related financial market crash. Our results indicate that higher levels of the sustainability performance of ETFs do not safeguard investments from financial losses during a severe market downturn.

Indeed, recent environmental, social, and financial crises have inevitably led regulators and investors to take into account the sustainable investing issue; however, the question of how Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria impact financial portfolio performances is still open. In this work, we examine a multi-objective optimization model for portfolio selection, where we add to the classical Mean-Variance analysis a third non-financial goal represented by the ESG scores. The resulting optimization problem, formulated as a convex quadratic programming, consists of minimizing the portfolio variance with parametric lower bounds on the levels of the portfolio expected return and ESG. We provide here an extensive empirical analysis on five datasets involving real-world capital market indexes from major stock markets. Our empirical findings typically reveal the presence of two behavioral patterns for the 16 Mean-Variance-ESG portfolios analyzed. Indeed, over the last fifteen years we can distinguish two non-overlapping time windows on which the inclusion of portfolio ESG targets leads to different regimes in terms of portfolio profitability. Furthermore, on the most recent time window, we observe that, for the US markets, imposing a high ESG target tends to select portfolios that show better financial performances than other strategies, whereas for the European markets the ESG constraint does not seem to improve the portfolio profitability. © 2022 by the authors.

The results show that ESG ratings significantly promote the quantity and quality of corporate green innovation and are mediated by alleviating financial constraints and increasing managers' environmental awareness. In this context, the higher the ESG rating score, the more apparent is the promotion effect. Furthermore, stricter environmental regulations, increased market competition, and companies in their growth period strengthen the association between ESG ratings and green innovation.

	abstract = {Against a backdrop of international public policies on sustainability such as SDGs, sustainable investment assets in the world stood at $30.7 trillion in 2018. In conjunction with the developing market of sustainable investment, academic research has proved that ESG performances positively affect financial performances in many cases. However, most of the previous studies have not analysed linkages between ESG performances and debt financing, nor have they targeted Asian markets. Thus, the purpose of this study is to analyse the effects of ESG performances on creditworthiness in Japanese companies. This empirical analysis used the ordered logit model where the dependent variable is S&P Credit Ratings, and the independent variables are ESG evaluations by Arabesque S-Ray. We used data for CY2019, and our final sample included 15 independent variables for 63 observations: 945 items were under the analysis. In result, we found that ESG total performance and governance performance positively affect a company’s creditworthiness, whilst there were no significant results concerning social and environmental performance. Therefore, business companies should consider improving governance performance for better credit ratings and financial institutions should consider governance performance in credit analysis. We also found that the effects of ESG total performance may change depending on whether ESG evaluations are based on financially material ESG issues, and that the effects of ESG total performance and pillar performances (environment, social, and governance, respectively) may differ. ESG evaluation agencies are recommended to disclose pillar performance evaluations with details of methodology for investors to consider ESG evaluations in investment decisions. © 2022, Japan Economic Policy Association (JEPA).},

To fill this gap, this paper uses computer-aided textual analysis to explore the current practices of CTTI4.0 in the UK context. It also uses quantitative analysis to examine the impact of CTTI4.0 information on financial performance. The analysis shows that strategic investment decision-making (SIDM) practices for CTTI4.0 have accelerated over the period, and these practices vary in industry sectors. Furthermore, it finds that CTTI4.0 disclosure has a positive impact on financial performance. In addition, it finds that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices moderate the relationship between CTTI4.0 disclosure and financial performance. This indicates that firms with better ESG performance tend to be more engaged in CTTI4.0 disclosure and better financial performance simultaneously. Our findings offer insights to decision-makers and regulatory bodies regarding the current practices of CTTI4.0 and its potential economic impact. Paper type: Research paper. © 2021},

Firms strengthen environmental, social, and governance (ESG) activities, which are critical elements for sustainable management. However, there are inconsistent findings on the relationship between ESG activities and firms’ financial performance in prior studies because of the lack of full consideration of internal mechanisms and external conditions. To overcome this limitation, this study investigates the mediating effect of non-financial performance and the moderating effect of the institutional environment on the relationship between firms’ ESG activities and their financial performance in a unified moderated mediation model. Sam-ples for empirical analyses were collected by a survey from 304 small and medium-sized Chinese manufacturers. The results of a mediation analysis reveal that each ESG activity has a positive effect on firms’ financial performance, and the impact of ESG activities on financial performance is completely mediated by non-financial performance. The results of a moderated mediation analysis further indicate that the mediating effect varies depending on the level of institutional pressure from the government, consumers, and competitors. The study suggests the need for interdisciplinary research in sustainable management and institutional theory and emphasizes the importance of sustainable management for performance improvement in a changing environment. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: The study aims to investigate the relationship between aggregate and individual dimensions of sustainability and financial and stock market performances of the firms in the travel and tourism industry (TTI) across different geographies. Design/methodology/approach: The sample under study consists of 146 firms belonging to TTI that have consistently obtained environmental, social and governance (ESG) rating over the period 2011–2017 as a part of Thomson Reuters Asset 4 ESG database. An empirical multivariate panel data model is developed to analyse the impact of sustainability (ESG) on firm profitability and market value within three tourism-related industries (transportation, hotel and leisure). Findings: The study extends the existing literature by investigating the impact of each of the vital dimensions of sustainability performance – ESG – and examines how each dimension would affect financial performance and market value among firms within three tourism-related industries (transportation, hotel and leisure). Among the three tourism industries, hotel industry is observed to have the highest ESG compliance, followed by the transportation industry. Based on the agency and stakeholder theory, the authors hypothesized all ESG components to have significant positive effect on the financial and stock market performance; however, the results reveal that each dimension has different impact on financial performance and market value of firms in the tourism industry. Research limitations/implications: The study could help firms in the travel and tourism industries to understand which of the dimension of ESG activities is significantly important for their financial and stock market performance. Originality/value: The unique contribution of this study is that it considers wider definition of the term “Sustainability” and examines the relationship between financial and stock market performances of the firms and each component of ESG. This is one of the few studies at the global level that provides much needed evidence in the area of sustainability performance by the travel and tourism firms. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Using fixed effect (FE) and pooled OLS suggest that ESG practices are positively associated with financial performance. This result implies that companies engaged in environmental, social and governance aspects have a higher shareholder value. A good economy condition encouraged companies to integrate ESG aspects and rewarded investors with good financial return (ROE). Companies with lesser governance practice would increase shareholders value (ROE). Essentially, this empirical evidence confirms stakeholder’s theory and agency theory.

The study here describes SOSDE in poultry products manufacturing but the propositions advanced are applicable across a wide span of industries. This study contributes by integrating prior organizational mental models, production economics, industrial marketing, and systems engineering principles in empirical applications.

The study sample consists of 203 listed companies on the S&P BSE 500 Index across eleven sectors. Materiality and immateriality indices were constructed, and a portfolio-level analysis was carried out by measuring a one-year-ahead abnormal stock return portfolio performance using a calendar-time portfolio approach. The econometric results show that companies that ranked lower on material and immaterial sustainability disclosure scores outperformed those with higher scores. Similarly, a portfolio constructed with a higher immaterial score has a negative abnormal return. Further, sustainability disclosure scores are not superior predictors of future financial performance. The present results offer an insight into the material variability of the sustainability issues and their concomitant effect on investment portfolio performance. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The absence of a standard for measuring the impact of non-financial performance on companies leaves to existent measures an important discretionary power to the company. As a result, each corporation could use the advantage of information asymmetry to give benefits to financial performance, even through greenwashing. In particular, analyzing European listed companies through IV-2SLS analysis and a robustness check with POLS we found a general positive and significant relationship between the two ESG scores and firm value. Overall, our findings underlined that a simultaneous study of the two ways to consider ESG shows that the ESG disclosure score has a bigger impact on firm value than the ESG performance score, boasting a higher magnitude. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The authors investigate the role of gender in the way firms evaluate and resolve the ethical dilemma founded on the corporate social responsibility–corporate financial performance (CSR–CFP) nexus. This study is premised on Gilligan's “two voices” theory and the social role theory that there is a gender-based difference in moral thinking. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt the two-stage least squares (2SLS) and generalized method of moments (GMM) approach to control for simultaneity between female representation on boards, CSR and financial performance. The sample consists of 9,569 firm-year observations from 1,527 US firms for the period 1996–2014. Findings: The authors find that CSR initiatives and activities undertaken by US firms are profit maximizing. However, the return on investment in CSR decreases with the proportion of female directors on the board. This study underscores the importance of considering gender in furthering the understanding of how firms address the CSR–CFP nexus. Research limitations/implications: This research is not without limitations, which includes the way the authors operationalize CSR. The CSR scores from the MSCI ESG database have been criticized for being relatively weak predictors of actual CSR outcomes. Since the CSR–CFP nexus is likely to be far more complex than that portrayed by the KLD scores, the authors encourage future research to explore metrics of other social rating agencies which perhaps better capture the quality of a firm's CSR. Practical implications: In the face of the long and unresolved debate on the effect of gender diversity on the board's monitoring efficacy and decision- making process (Adams and Ferrera, 2009), the authors’ finding that female directors' moral orientation and investment in CSR affect firms' bottom-line figures has important implications for shareholders and regulators, helping them to see how gender may play an important role in addressing this relationship. Originality/value: Although prior studies provide useful insights into the nexus between CSR and CFP, little is known whether gender affects this relation. This research provides empirical support for Gilligan's “two voices” theory that there is a gender-based difference in moral thinking. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Two types of control variables complete the regression analysis in this study: firm-specific and macroeconomic. Findings: The findings elicited from the empirical results of the linear models demonstrate that there is a significant relationship between ESG and operational performance (ROA) and market performance (TQ).

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to examine the impact of directors' home regions on corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure. Specifically, the authors aim to determine whether Anglo-American, European, French, other European and other regional directors' presence affects CSR disclosure differently. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical study uses panel data analysis of all listed firms on the SBF 120 from 2008 to 2019. The environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores are collected from the Bloomberg database and indicate the extent of CSR information disclosure by French companies. The paper is based on a dynamic generalized method of moments panel estimator that makes it possible to control for unobservable heterogeneity and endogeneity and reduces estimation bias. Findings: The findings of this study provide evidence that home region diversity and the presence of Anglo-Americans on a board are positively and significantly associated with ESG disclosure and environmental disclosure, whereas they are negatively associated with social and governance disclosure. Surprisingly, when directors come from European countries, they disclose less ESG and environmental information. Nevertheless, when only French directors are present, the company tends to divulge all dimensions of CSR. Indeed, while there is a significant positive influence of French directors on ESG disclosure, the presence of other European directors displays negative and statistically significant regression coefficients. Research limitations/implications: This study may be interesting the French policy makers who can now pay more appropriate attention to directors' nationality or region. Thus, firms should identify the foreign directors who can support their strategy with relevant experience in terms of CSR. This could help to change the opinion of some companies that consider the internalization of the board as a constraint rather than an opportunity. These results will be useful for French-listed companies in setting the criteria for the appointment of foreign directors. It may be interesting to recruit directors across European boundaries. Practical implications: This paper attempts to provide a better understanding of the effects of the home regions of directors on CSR disclosure in order to enlighten corporate managers whose companies operate in different cultures given that they have to deal with this aspect. In this international business environment, CEOs should increasingly consider the international CSR experience of directors to be a resource. In addition, this study may be of relevance to French market authorities, which constantly encourage firms to diversify the profiles of directors on their boards and recruit more international members. Originality/value: This study is the first to evince that the disclosure of each CSR disclosure score differs depending on the directors' home regions. Unlike previous studies, the authors focused simultaneously on the resource-based view (RBV) and institutional theory. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Corporations have significant resources that enterprises need to develop. Many enterprises are looking at new tech companies and searching for opportunities to reap the benefits associated with their work. They also offer access to large markets where small companies would like to start operating. These types of entities also provide stability and have the ability to scale actions. Enterprises can quickly master technologies, create products and services based on them, and easily implement changes in operational strategies, which is difficult for very large companies with an extensive decision-making structure. Therefore, each party can offer something that is desired by the other. The relevance of the study is conditioned by the fact that the success of young companies can make a really big impression. Some of them achieve results that allow them to catch up with the current market leaders and take their positions. The purpose is to consider the interaction of enterprises with financial corporations and factors influencing the improvement of their relationships. Possible collaboration between companies and financial corporations can take many forms, such as an acceleration or incubation programme, equity investments. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the interest of financial corporations in investing in technology companies. Thus, corporations have the opportunity to increase the scale of operations in the field of investment in enterprises. The practical significance lies in solving problems that affect the overall state of interaction between enterprises and financial institutions in Ukraine.Keywords: Corporate Financial Performance, ESG score, Fama & French, Stock Returns, Sustainability.

The article is based on an empirical analysis through a content analysis approach based on a sample of 64 GCC banks from 2014 to 2020. The findings showed that the frequency of website visits significantly affects the financial performance measures of banks, such as return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), market value (Tobin’s Q), net interest margin (NIM) and return on investment (ROI). In addition, the ESG performance of banks attracts more website visitors and enhances them with the idea of dealing with banks that enhances financial performance. The findings indicate that banking websites as a tool for public relations attract visitors and thus turn them into customers by changing the behavioural intention of individuals, which affects their decisions to engage in banking transactions and thus raises the level of financial performance of banks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examines the relationship between website visits and financial performance. Therefore, it bridges the research gap in this field and thus provides a roadmap for more potential research ideas in the future. © 2022 International Management Institute, New Delhi.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether board gender diversity is associated with corporate sustainability performance and whether industry-level product market competition moderates the effect of board gender diversity on corporate sustainability performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses international data extracted from global ESG data set from Thomson Reuters (Refinitiv) database. Using data of 23,137 firm-year observations from 37 countries, the authors perform regression analyses to examine the hypotheses. Findings: The findings show that firms with high board gender diversity exhibit high corporate sustainability performance. The authors also find firms in highly competitive industries to have low corporate sustainability performance. In highly competitive industries, the positive relationship between board gender diversity and corporate sustainability performance is weakened. The results are robust to various specification tests such as alternative measures for corporate sustainability performance, board gender diversity, product market competition and also the use of propensity score matching to address endogeneity issue. Overall, the results support the prediction that board diversity and product market competition play a substitutive role in influencing corporate sustainability performance. Research limitations/implications: This study offers empirical evidence that the appointment of female directors is a useful way to improve a firm’s corporate sustainability performance, hence, providing significant benefits in terms of stakeholders’ values and corporate reputation. Practical implications: This study provides useful insights to investors and policymakers that intense industry competition might mitigate the role of board governance, particularly board gender diversity, in enhancing corporate sustainability performance. Originality/value: Using an international data set, where the observations operate in various market and institutional differences, this study is able to extricate the positive impact of board gender diversity and product market competition on corporate sustainability performance. This study corroborates evidence that sustainability strategy and initiatives are reflections of integrated factors, including corporate governance as internal driver and market forces faced by firms as external driver. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Furthermore, the stepwise regression method was used, and the secondary data used were sourced from financial reports and Indonesian macroeconomic data. The first step results showed Debt to Equity Ratio has a positive and significant effect on stock returns, while the ESG Score, Return on Assets, and Firm Size do not have an effect. The results of the second step showed the model is simultaneously not feasible and the macroeconomic variables need to be removed. Therefore, it was concluded that a good model is one with ESG Score and financial performance variables that affect stock return, while macroeconomic variables need to be excluded from the model. © 2022, Econjournals.

We provide evidence that heterogeneity in rating criteria can lead agencies to have opposite opinions on the same evaluated companies and that agreement across those providers is substantially low. Those alternative definitions of ESG also affect sustainable investments leading to the identification of different investment universes and consequently to the creation of different benchmarks. This implies that in the asset management industry it is extremely difficult to measure the ability of a fund manager if financial performances are strongly conditioned by the chosen ESG benchmark. Finally, we find that the disagreement in the scores provided by the rating agencies disperses the effect of preferences of ESG investors on asset prices, to the point that even when there is agreement, it has no impact on financial performances. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Corporates play a vital role in the economy and are subject to growing expectations from stakeholders. Therefore, it is essential to understand the financial impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on corporates’ activities. This article examines the impact of CSR on 30 Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)-listed corporate efficiencies by using multi-criteria decision-making models. The article emphasized the technical efficiency of 30 BSE-listed corporates and explored high-efficiency drivers. This study applies multiple methods, that is, data envelopment analysis and free disposal hull, to observe the efficiency rankings of the 30 BSE Index-listed companies for 6 years, that is, 2014–2020. In the second stage, we perform truncated regression analysis to validate our results on the association between CSR and the financial performance of the corporate. The findings suggest that 6 out of 30 corporates are technically efficient (TE = 1) in all frontier approaches. Furthermore, the outcomes portray those three pillars of CSR (i.e., environment, social and governance) are positively correlated with efficiency. Furthermore, it has also been observed that environment and social scores are positively related to return on assets. The findings can be helpful for the stakeholders, policymakers and management of the corporate as a guideline to implement CSR practices. © 2022 Fortune Institute of International Business.},

The concepts Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) and Environmental Social Governance (ESG) are indeed ubiquitous in the current investment and pension community. This article aims to provide some insight into the conceptual relationship between SRI and ESG and its legal implications for the investment behaviour of private pension funds in the USA and the EU. Hence, the first part of the article gives some background to the distinct concepts of SRI and ESG. This leads to the finding that SRI goes one step further than ESG by prioritising moral or ethical considerations that may not be material to an investment’s financial performance, whereas ESG functions as a guideline to enhance financial performance. The second part analyses the legal possibilities and constraints for responsible investment in American occupational pensions and the third part does the same for European occupational pensions.

Findings from descriptive analysis show that board diversity tends to be higher with banks endowed with low financial leverage and high assets. Cross-country analysis shows that Central America evinces the highest levels of board diversity among banks. In Europe, however, repose the highest levels of environmental and social disclosure among banks. In contrast, the highest level of governance disclosure among banks obtains in Australia. A regression model partially corroborates the gender board diversity as a causal factor of the corporate governance disclosure inasmuch as, when female board members account for 22–50% of the board, a positive significant effect on the level of ESG disclosure results. However, at levels above 50%, negative returns to scale manifest on ESG disclosure from female board participation. Given the effect on the latter on the former uncovered by this research, regulators ought to mandate quotas of female participation on bank boards to engender sustainable increases in the level of ESG reporting on the part of banks. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {Environmental disclosure is the latest novelty in the corporate reporting field. In fact, it is a tool that can better represent the capacity of companies in creating financial performance over time. Therefore, this paper analyzes whether environmental disclosure (ED) practiced by firms listed on the ESG index affects their financial performance (FP) using the moderating effect of social and ethical practices. The analysis includes a linear regression using panel data from Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg databases. Panel data were collected from a sample of 523 companies listed on the North American and West European stock exchanges. The obtained results show a positive and significant relationship between environmental disclosure (ED) and financial performance (FP). This implies that a strong environmental disclosure increases financial performance while a weak one decreases it. Furthermore, the study suggests a moderating effect of social and ethical practices in the link between environmental disclosure and the firm’s financial performance. In fact, these findings provide interesting insights for academic practitioners and regulators who are interested in discovering environmental disclosure, firm’s performance, and social and ethical practices. These findings also provide insights to stakeholders and regulators on the crucial need to integrate more social and environmental regulations to promote sustainability. Moreover, this paper fills the gaps existing in previous studies that ignore the moderating role of social and ethical practices in the relationship between environmental disclosure and financial performance. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores play a pivotal role in the strategic design of firms. The literature has demonstrated the importance of sustainability issues in the financial performance of firms around the world. In particular, understanding the relationship between sustainability and the cost of capital is crucial for determining financial strategy and decision making. We identify an opportunity in the literature to analyze this relationship within Latin America (LatAm) firms. Thus, this study analyzes the relationship between ESG scores with the cost of capital of firms with headquarters in LatAm using a data set that includes 606 observations corresponding to information about 202 firms from 2017 to 2019. To conduct our analysis, two fixed effects panel data models were estimated. We model this relationship by taking ESG scores and each of its ESG Pillar scores—i.e., Environmental, Social, and Governance pillar scores—as independent variables and analyzing how they affect the cost of capital. According to the results, there is an inverse effect relationship between ESG scores and the cost of capital. Additionally, we did not find a relationship between the Social Pillar score and the Environmental Pillar score with the cost of capital. By contrast, the Governance Pillar score shows a negative relationship with the cost of capital. This indicates that the increase in transparency about internal processes and governance entities can be an essential driver of value creation for firms and higher financing confidence in LatAm firms. This study represents a breakthrough in explaining the impact of ESG scores on the cost of capital in LatAm. Ultimately, the current study presents the potential for further research in this field. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Sustainable growth is the key global priority, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives have become the main point of attention in companies’ digital transformation strategies. ESG and digital transformation reinforce each other as they aim to improve efficiency and meet stakeholders inside and outside the company. This is true for telecommunication companies, where disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data or cloud computing are reshaping the industry. Assessment of the impact of sustainability disclosures on companies’ value is a task of high interest for academics and practitioners from telecommunication companies. ESG disclosure serves as a key channel to inform investors about the efficiency of ESG risk management and control practices of the firm and thus can impact the firm’s financial performance and market value. However, there are numerous controversies in the academic literature on this topic and a lack of research specifically for the telecommunication industry. We closed the research gaps and investigated the impact of ESG disclosure on Tobin-Q of 93 US-listed telecommunication service companies between 2011-2021. We found that aggregated ESG disclosure score positively impacted telecoms’ Tobin-Q. Among individual ESG disclosure pillars, only corporate governance positively influenced Tobin-Q, while the impact of environmental and social pillars was statistically insignificant. We also found that CEO duality significantly and negatively impacted Tobin-Q. The presence of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee, greater gender diversity and a higher percentage of independent directors on the board positively affected the value of the telecoms. The result of the study can be applied in developing ESG rating methodologies for telecommunication companies. They can also assist telecom companies’ managers and stakeholders to identify key value drivers of the ESG agenda. © 2022,International Journal of Technology.All Rights Reserved.},

Private stakeholders’ expected roles and responsibilities in the area of international development cooperation have been augmented. The article explores the various factors driving this phenomenon from the perspectives of the public and private sectors. The case study of Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) is carried out by analyzing the identified factors in the context of KOICA’s PPP strategy. The study found that the motives of the private sector to participate in KOICA’s global CSR program is less likely to be satisfied under the current arrangement whereas the public sector is highly motivated to attract and engage businesses in delivering PPP projects abroad. The study suggests policy implications such as incorporating non-financial performance indicators in evaluation criteria, resolving administrative challenges, and increasing the budget for PPP programs. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose: This study investigates the relationship between the level of sustainability disclosure and telecommunication and information technology (IT) sectors' performance (operational, financial and market). Design/methodology/approach: Using data culled from 4,458 observations from 60 different countries for 10 years (2008–2017), an independent variable derived from environmental, social and governance (ESG) score are regressed against dependent manufacture performance indicator variables [return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and Tobin's Q (TQ)]. Two types of control variables complete the regression analysis in this study: firm-specific and macroeconomic. Findings: The findings elicited from the empirical results demonstrate that there is a significant negative relationship between ESG and market performance (TQ). However, there is no significant effect of ESG on both operational (ROA) and financial performance (ROE). Moreover, the findings elicited from the partial least square structural equation modeling the relationship between ESG and ROA is stronger in emerging than in developed economies. Practical implications: The authors' opinion for policy makers is that it is essential to promote and implement the appropriate legislative framework for sustainability reporting, which should enhance both the sustainability practices as well the profitability of IT firms. Originality/value: The model in this study presents a valuable analytical framework for exploring sustainability disclosure as a driver of performance in telecommunication and IT sectors' economies. In addition, this study highlights telecommunication and IT sectors' management lacunae manifesting in terms of the weak nexus between each component of ESG and IT sectors' performance. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The term 'sustainable development' had appeared in the 1980s. However, in Russia, until recently, it has been used mainly in academia, primarily by scientists dealing with environmental issues. Now we can state that the interest regarding this subject is growing day by day. The government is playing increasing role in promoting the idea of sustainable development. Russian business especially large high-technology companies, in turn, follow modern trends and declare their commitment to ESG principles, which in a broad sense represent the implementation of the sustainable development concept in commercial activities. Considering the requirements of the ESG-agenda in the formation of a company's communication strategy particularly in a digital environment makes it possible to improve the company's reputation with various stakeholder groups, primarily the government and society. Whereas refusal from such course of conduct may result in serious damage to both the corporate brand image and financial results of the company. The article examines the impact of ESG factors on the building of positive reputation among normative and diffuse stakeholder groups. The specifics of the use of Russian and foreign tools for monitoring non-financial performance of business units are determined. The dynamics of ESG indices changes as well as quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the degree of commitment to ESG principles of the largest Russian telecommunication companies are analyzed. Based on this analysis, the authors propose directions for introducing ESG-agenda in the communication strategy of large high-technology corporations particularly in a digital environment.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The purpose of this study is to identify the causal relationships of the four dimensions (financial performance, bond financing, environmental, social, governance, and COVID-19) and 20 criteria affecting the sustainability of global shipping companies. The research scope includes a sample of nine listed international shipping companies accounting for 49% of the global market share with data collected from 2010 to 2020. Survey responses from 15 investment experts were also obtained. We applied a hybrid multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) method integrating the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), analytic network process, and modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno techniques to be the DANP-mV model to identify the causal relationships among the dimensions and criteria, providing ways of narrowing the performance gaps of shipping companies. The results indicate that financial performance is the main cause affecting COVID-19 and ESG practices. The ESG practices influence bond financing. The largest performance gaps across shipping companies include earnings per share (EPS), yield to maturity, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and timely delivery. The findings of this study suggest that shipping companies may focus on gross profit margin to improve EPS, term to maturity to enhance yield to maturity, social distancing policy to meet timely delivery, and the board size to enhance corporate social responsibility (CSR).

For this purpose, the CFP is measured by ROCE and ROA. The ESG overall disclosure and factor scores are obtained from Bloomberg Terminals. The final dataset includes 77 companies for the sample period of 2015-2019. Eight different OLS multivariate regression analyses are performed. The first two is for overall ESG disclosure score, and then six different regressions are for each of E, S, and G factors with control variables such as company size, leverage, BTMV, age, growth, ownership and industry. The findings of this examination confirmed our hypothesis that better ESG disclosures practices positively and significantly affect CFP. Regression results found that there is a positive relationship between the ESG disclosure scores and CFP as well as the individual ESG factor scores except for social disclosures. The better ESG disclosures help the companies to improve their CFP and create a good image, credibility, and promote corporate ethical practices. Moreover, in all eight regression models organizations' leverage and growth was found statistically positively and significantly linkage with CFP. However, this paper did not find any evidence to support that sample firms’ size, BTMV, age, industry, and ownership affect CFP.

	abstract = {During recent times of uncertainty, sustainable marketing and sustainable finance became hot research topics attracting both academics and practitioners. Although centering marketing efforts around the firm’s Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policies allow for creating a superior image and increasing brand value, the incorporation of ESG/CSR activities might seem to be costly and have been claimed to not provide direct marketing benefits. This study aims to explore the impact of firms’ ESG/CSR engagement on marketing expenses and firms’ market value to provide a strategic rationale for firms to undertake ESG/CSR activities to position their companies distinctly in the marketplace accordingly. The study employs a panel regression to analyze the impact of ESG and CSR commitments on a firm’s marketing expenses in a sample of S&P 500 firms in the United States. The results indicate that the firms with higher CSR engagement spend proportionately lesser on their marketing expenses and entertain a higher market value. The results also suggest that the firm’s board size, board diversity, and social engagement considerably enhance the firm’s market value. The results indicate that focusing on firms’ environmental responsibility alone does not sufficiently contribute to enhancing the value of the firm, stakeholders are rather more concerned about the firm’s societal engagement which must, therefore, be overtly communicated and reported. © 2022 The Author(s).

This research proves that countries and companies lined up with climate change laws are better options for investing and mitigating risks. The sample of the study is based on a net zero emission criteria, so six countries were identified with approved legislation, and a comparison between the largest market cap firms of these countries and the largest market cap of the world (Benchmark) is made to analyze their FP during the COVID-19 first year. Furthermore, regression models were run to review which ESG factor is the most related to predicting the ESG combined score for the firms. The results show that the firms had a better performance than the Benchmark and that the social factor ‘S’ is the most correlated to the ESG combined score. The relevance of this article lies with the relevance of investing in companies aligned with net zero emissions laws since they contribute to improving the expected return even in a volatile era. © 2022 The Author(s).

This study also analyzes whether sustainable management influences investors’ assessments of earnings persistence. According to previous studies, sustainable management activities ultimately have a positive effect on corporate financial performance and corporate value by satisfying the desires of not only shareholders, but also various actors concerned with social contributions and reduced information asymmetry. In addition, the transparency of financial reporting increases as earnings management decreases due to ethical management. So this study predicts that excellent sustainable management activities will improve earnings persistence and investors use as a signal to correctly price the persistence of earnings. This research uses the ESG ratings as a proxy for sustainable management and sample size is 3,247 in Korea securities market. The empirical results show that there is a significant positive relationship between higher ESG grades and earnings and earnings components. And by the method of Mishkin (1983), investors correctly price the persistence of earnings and earnings components based upon sustainable management activities. The results in this study helps to improve our understanding of the impact of sustainable management for earnings quality and investors’ evaluation of earnings quality. © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: Environmental, social and governance factors have gained significant traction for investors to evaluate their investment decisions and achieve higher impact investments. Societies have had a growing impact on investors to ensure that besides profitability factors, the impact on the environment, society and internal governance criteria are taken into account when allocating funds. This has led to a growing divestment from highly polluting industries and corporations that are not diverse in their workforce, or have a negative impact on the society such as using forced labor. Islamic finance encompasses the principles of Shariah law that put a strong focus on preserving the environment and support the society. Evaluating whether corporations are Shariah compliant with respect to the environment is challenging, as environmental ESG scores may not adequately represent the entire impact on the environment and the Shariah-environment compliance of corporations. Method: This article presents a new data-driven framework for the assessment of Shariah – environmental compliance for corporations in addition to their financial performance. Results and conclusion: An analysis based on large Islamic compliant US listed enterprises indicate strong clustering performance, and differentiation in terms of Islamic environmental compliance versus non-compliance. Originality: The deep learning framework incorporates an unsupervised-random forest learning approach at categorizing environmental compliance while simultaneously estimating the financial performance of these corporations. © 2022 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

	abstract = {Sustainable and responsible finance incorporates Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into business decisions and investment strategies. In recent years, investors have rushed to Sustainable and Responsible Investments in response to growing concerns about the risks of climate change. Asset managers look for some assessment of sustainability for guidance and benchmarking, for instance, $30 trillion of assets are invested using some ESG ratings. Several studies argue that good ESG ratings helped to prop up stock returns during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (Lins et al. J Finance 72(4):1785–1824, 2017). The ESG score represents a benchmark of disclosures on public and private firms, it is based on different characteristics which are not directly related to the financial performance (Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance, ESG reports and ratings:what they are, why they matter. https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/07/27/esg-reports-and-ratings-what-they-are-why-they-matter/, 2017). The role of ESG ratings and their reliability have been widely discussed (Berg et al. Aggregate confusion: the divergence of ESG ratings, MIT Sloan Research Paper No. 5822-19, 2019). Sustainable investment professionals are unsatisfied with publicly traded companies’ climate-related disclosure. This negative sentiment is particularly strong in the USA, and within asset managers who do not believe that markets are consistently and correctly pricing climate risks into company and sector valuations. We believe that ESG ratings, when available, still affect business and finance strategies and may represent a crucial element in the company’s fundraising process and on shares returns. We aim to assess how structural data as balance sheet items and income statements items for traded companies affect ESG scores. Using the Bloomberg ESG scores, we investigate the role of structural variables adopting a machine learning approach, in particular, the Random Forest algorithm. We use balance sheet data for a sample of the constituents of the Euro Stoxx 600 index, referred to the last decade, and investigate how these explain the ESG Bloomberg ratings. We find that financial statements items represent a powerful tool to explain the ESG score. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Associazione per la Matematica Applicata alle Scienze Economiche e Sociali (AMASES).},

Using the theoretical framework of stakeholder theory, we apply regression analysis to obtain quantitative evidence on CSR-CFP relations. The companies’ CSR involvement is measured by their reputation index provided by CSRhub – transparent data platform developing consensus ratings of companies’ ESG performance all around the world. The return on equity ratio is used as a measure of corporate financial performance. The sample consists of 45 Russian and 55 Dutch companies from the CSRhub list (2017 data.) We study all companies rated by CS-Rhub from two European countries – Russia as an emerging economy and the Netherlands as the developed country with a coordinated market economy. Our findings demonstrate a weak positive correlation between CSR and the companies’ ROE. The CSR has a higher impact on the financial performance of Russian companies than on their Dutch counterparts. The proposed explanations relate to the different levels of business risk and trust in these countries, the dissimilar nature (mandatory and voluntary) of non-financial reporting, and the transparency of national businesses for investors. Different perceptions of business risk by investors as well as different levels of company transparency may explain the lower CSR effect on the performance of Dutch companies in comparison to the Russian case. These results may be used by corporate management for assessing financial returns from CSR strategies. © 2022, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, investors have perceived that Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices significantly increase the value of companies' stocks. This study investigates the impact of ESG inclusion on the price, liquidity and financial performance of stocks listed in the Indian ESG indices. Two major Indian benchmark ESG Indices, the BSE100 ESG and Nifty 100 ESG, were considered for the study. A total sample of 64 firms from the BSE100 ESG index and 86 firms from the Nifty100 ESG index were selected. The market model of the event study methodology was employed to measure AAR and CAAR and to demonstrate the effect before and after the inclusion of the stocks in the ESG indices. The empirical results show a highly significant negative AAR on the announcement day, i.e., on (day = 0) for BSE100 ESG index stocks and an insignificant positive AAR for Nifty100 ESG index stocks. In addition, the results also document a significant negative CAAR for BSE 100 ESG stocks and a positive insignificant CAAR for Nifty100 ESG stocks. Moreover, the liquidity test results revealed a considerable liquidity enhancement in the stocks posts their inclusion in the BSE100 ESG. At the same time, there were no significant changes in the liquidity ratio of stocks after being included in the Nifty100 ESG index. This study concludes that there will be a substantial improvement in the companies' financial performance as indicated by EPS and market capitalization after their inclusion in the ESG indices. © Suresha B., Srinidhi V.

Here, we use a sample of 25 Indian firms listed for their sustainability performances in the Thomson Reuters Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) scores. The sustainability performance data have been accessed from the Bloomberg terminal, where the overall sustainability performance on ESG is measured as a discounted score on ESG considering various controversies on ESG reported for the firm. And for the study, we associate financial data using the profit indicators of firms. We perceive that the sustainable supply chain practices considering environmental, social and governance performances may not positively impact the financial performance measured by the Return on Asset (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE), during the considered period of five years for the study. We construct the empirical model and use Partial Least Square (PLS) regression modeling to analyze the results. The study can be further extended for many Indian firms and for firms across different developing economies, as well. The major implications of this research are to observe for firms and their supply chains whether the implementation of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices can help them in achieving financial benefits, along with other competitive advantages.

	abstract = {Purpose: The concept of materiality is becoming increasingly important for sustainability performance measurement and reporting. It is widely agreed upon that materiality matters, in the sense that companies should identify, prioritize and disclose information on sustainability issues that are considered material. There is, however, a tension at the heart of this consensus, owing to parallel approaches to materiality being used in practice. This paper aims to shed light on how and why the parallel uses of the materiality concept may cause confusion and how this tension could be resolved. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes as point of departure the tension between two approaches to materiality: based on the Global Reporting Initiative definition, which emphasizes sustainability issues that are important to stakeholders and that have significant impacts and based on the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board definition, which emphasizes sustainability issues that are financially material, i.e. likely to influence the financial performance of the company. This paper discusses the nature and consequences of the tensions between how the two definitions of materiality in sustainability reporting are used in practice, with a particular emphasis on users of information in financial markets. This paper provides empirical insight on these users’ perspectives through a survey (n = 30) and qualitative interviews (n = 6) of financial market professionals. Findings: This study reveals tensions between different approaches to materiality in practice and how this may lead users of sustainability reports to draw unjustified conclusions on the basis of materiality assessments. Specifically, this paper demonstrates the perceived shortcomings in information availability and information quality from the perspectives of different stakeholders in financial markets with different information needs. Practical implications: The users of sustainability reporting information require clarity in the communication of materiality in non-financial reports. This paper addresses how such clarity can be pursued. Social implications: Clarity about materiality in non-financial reporting is important both for investors that pursue financial return on green investments and for society at large, which relies on information about real sustainability impacts. Originality/value: This paper furthers the understanding of how different materiality concepts may be problematic and how recent and ongoing developments may mitigate the risks of conflating uses of the concept. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The benefits and advantages of the incorporation of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governing)-related policies have been discussed extensively. However, research articles focus not only on the socioecological aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) but also on the underlying effects on a corporation’s corporate financial performance (CFP). In this regard, the current study aims to analyze the impact of ESG parameters on corporations’ financial stability. A sample size of 691 companies in North American countries was investigated in order to test the hypothesis that ESG has an effect on the likelihood of a company going bankrupt using the Ohlson O-score. This is conducted using regression models and the Pearson correlation coefficient. Furthermore, a follow-up hypothesis on the relationship between firm size and ESG is also tested in order to evaluate a tendency of corporate growth through ESG-based sustainable development. The results of the study conclude that the governing pillar of ESG factors has the highest positive impact on corporations’ financial success. Furthermore, the analysis conducted in the study with its sample size confirms the hypothesis that larger firms tend to have higher ESG scores. © 2022 by the authors.

The non-parametric method of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to determine their efficiency. Results indicate that, given the level of profitability, the variable that most affects the generation of sustainable value is corporate governance (G), followed by environmental (E) and social (S) practices. The main limitation of the study is the sample size. The originality of this paper lies in the fact that it determines corporate efficiency using financial performance as an input of a DEA model and sustainable value ratings as outputs. Conclusions show that corporate social responsibility activities may enhance firms’ sustainable efficiency. Therefore, it is proposed that corporate efficiency might be complemented by sustainable value measurements. © 2022 Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Corporate sustainability integrates financial performance with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Due to their personal characteristics, women can play an important role in promoting sustainable actions and strategic decision-making, creating positive effects on a company’s financial performance. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the effect of Board gender diversity on financial performance, in the context of Portuguese listed companies. Financial performance was measured through an accounting-based measure, the return on assets (ROA), and a market-based measure, the Tobin’s Q. Board gender diversity was proxied through several measures identified in the literature and the information needed to construct them was manually collected from the corporate governance reports. A regression analysis was conducted on panel data consisting of 29 companies from the period from 2010 to 2019. The results show that female presence is positively related with ROA when there are at least two women on the Board, or when the proportion of women is, at the least, 20%. A positive relationship was also found between the Tobin’s Q and the presence of at least 20% women on the Board. The results confirm the existence of the positive effects of Board gender diversity on financial performance, as predicted by resource dependence theory and agency theory, but only when a critical mass of women is reached. In general, we conclude that, although gender diversity promotion measures underlying Portuguese legislation are not yet fully consolidated, the imposed threshold of 20% women on Boards is a signal sent to the market and one that is valued by investors. © 2022 by the authors.

The potential moderating role of firm size and age has also been studied in an effort to disentangle their relationships in this context. In particular, the analysis involves interaction effects for two types of firms: full-service and low-cost carriers. Based on the collected data from 38 airlines worldwide for the period 2009 to 2019, we observed that contributions to governance initiatives improve a firm’s market-to-book ratio. We also found that a firm’s participation in social and environmental activities is positively and significantly rewarded by a higher level of financial efficiency. Additionally, firm size is the relevant moderator for the association between sustainability disclosure and both firm value and FP in the air transport industry. We therefore propose that a managerial strategy of participating in these initiatives may adapt them based on their total assets as proxy of firm size. In regard to firm age, we did not find it to be a significant moderator. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The paper provides a high-view picture and visualizes research to portray the historical shifts in sustainability reporting nexus to corporate governance through an analysis utilizing CiteSpace software on 935 articles published in Web of Science Core Collection from 2009 to 2021. The number of papers in the area has expanded, especially since 2013 (a branching point), while the study determines a type of bifurcation spot (the year 2017) that evinces the SR-CG field maturity. The study determined the dominant countries through affiliated to them researchers (the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, China and Australia), the most esteemed journals (Journal of Business Ethics, Business Strategy and the Environment and Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal), and the major co-occurrence of hot keywords (carbon disclosure project, environmental disclosure quality, integrated reporting, financial performance, foreign director, environmental reporting, public sector, sustainability assurance statement). The paper identifies principal issues where SR-CG research lags (dearth of those research in developing economies and geographical limitation of research) and unravels uncharted so far domains (jurisdictions-related studies) in the realm. Future research in the realm is likely to focus on ESG, disclosures and governance performance, as well as on specific areas (geography, industry, etc.), and will explore in depth the role of multiple factors together. This papers indicate the growing convergence between SR and CG in literature, and given predominance of ‘SR as a function of CG’ approach a more stalwart and sound CG framework could bring about more tenable SR practices. The paper puts forward an agenda for advancing forthcoming research in the realm of SR-CG interdependence. © Oleh Pasko, Fuli Chen, Tetyana Kuts, Inna Sharko, Natalia Ryzhikova, 2022.},

However, a significant research gap remains unexplored; specifically, prior scholars have ignored path research about the effect of ESG performance on corporate innovation, and they have also ignored the impacts of the heterogeneity of stakeholders. Therefore, taking China’s A-share listed companies as an example, the research applied linear regressions with panel data, using the ESG rating of SynTao Green Finance Agency as a proxy variable of ESG performance. The results show that ESG performance significantly promotes the quantity and quality of corporate innovation and is mediated by alleviating the financial constraints and agency cost. Internal and external governance plays different roles; the higher institutional investors’ attention as an external governance form does not help enterprises improve the quantity and quality of corporate innovation; however, CEO duality as an internal governance form strengthens the effect of ESG performance on corporate innovation. This study provides scientific evidence for the effect and effect path of ESG performance on promoting proactive innovation based on sustainable development in China; furthermore, the study reveals the heterogeneity factors of ESG performance on the innovation effect under stakeholder theory. © 2022 by the author.

The paper examines a sample of 57 U.S. non-financial firms belonging to the S&P 500. The Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) estimation is employed with an instrumental variable-the political views of the states where the studied firms are located. The paper shows that having a better practice of ESG could enhance firms’ financial performance measured by ROA, ROE, and TobinQ. These findings are consistent with the stakeholder-focused theory instead of shareholder-focus perspective. In addition, the magnitude of the influence of the ESG practice on TobinQ is significantly higher than that of the ESG-ROA and ESG-ROE relations. It reveals that the ESG benefits could make the firms appear more attractive to investors, creating higher market values of the firms’ assets and then higher TobinQ ratio. Not as the TobinQ enhancement, the significant improvement in ROA and ROE would be realized in the long run rather than short term. The low managerial ownership in the U.S. market may increase the chance of ESG overinvestment by the firms’ managers, hence reducing firm value. However, under the pressure of the investors’ strong demand for socially responsible investing, the U.S. firms tend to become involved in ESG activities, obtaining a strong stakeholder commitment and thus creating additional firm value in the long run. © 2022 Australasian Accounting Business and Finance Journal and Authors.},

	abstract = {An uphill question of whether Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) directly impact firms' financial performance (FP) continues to vacillate between two opponent streams. In the present study, we argue that COVID-19 is an extreme event where the effect of ESG sharply manifests. We rely on cross-sectional data in the context of G20 countries for the year 2020. To avoid biased results due to governments support, we integrate four novel metrics provided by the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). We run sequential regressions (OLS; and quartiles to account for the Ingrained Income Bias (IIB) and ESG scores). We also perform robustness tests and account for the interaction between ESG and cash level. Our models were subsequently replicated for each ESG pillar. Findings indicate that ESG is beneficial during COVID-19, but the reward appears to be closely tied up to specific aspects of ESG, income level, and firm-specific variables. Results contribute to the burgeoning literature on ESG during COVID-19 by reflecting on firms’ key attributes and the preponderance of government support. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The last two decades have seen a gradual shift in the reporting practices of the corporate sector across the globe. Besides reporting the standard financial statements, there is increased emphasis on qualitative reporting particularly issues related to governance, sustainability and society, popularly referred to as environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting (Griffin & Sun, 2018). In this regard, sustainability issues are being more aggressively addressed by the firms. This study aims at identifying and empirically examining the antecedents that influence the relationship between ESG disclosures of organisations and its corporate financial performance (CFP). The study uses a sample of BSE-200 companies and employs multiple regression technique to ascertain the ESG–CFP relationship. The results obtained show that ESG and CFP are negatively related, and the control variables have a significant impact on this association. The study provides insights from the perspective of an emerging economy and contributes to both the managerial decision-making and policy formulation.

The final report on the new E.U. taxonomy for sustainable activities was released in 2020, making ESG disclosure more relevant. This paper investigates the effects of ESG initiatives on the financial performance of Norwegian listed companies from 2010 to 2019. ESG is measured through the Thomson Reuters Eikon ESG disclosure score and financial performance through ROA and Tobin’s Q. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this relationship has been investigated in Norway. Using panel data regression analysis and two proxies for the dependent variable (financial performance), the results of this study are mixed. In particular, findings suggest a strong significant relationship between ESG initiatives and financial performance. More specifically, the regression model, with ROA as the dependent variable, suggests that ESG initiatives have a clear negative impact. On the other hand, the variable Tobin’s Q increases when ESG increases. This could be explained by the different horizons of the measures and other factors affecting the business environment. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Despite the noble ideas, sustainability practices remain neglected in theory, policy, and selectively practiced by Malaysian corporations, possibly due to unclear impacts. This study aimed to provide an empirical analysis on the impact of sustainability practices on firm performance in the context of Malaysia using both aggregate and disaggregated environmental, social and governance (ESG). The study sample consisted of 36 public listed firms in Malaysia that have been consistently reporting ESG scores from 2015 to 2019. Static panel regression was used to analyse the data in annual frequency. In aggregate level, the results indicated a positive relationship between sustainability (ESG) and firm financial performance such as, return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and Tobin’s Q (TQ), but only significant for ROE. In disaggregate, the result revealed that there is a significant positive relationship between S score with (ROE and TQ) and G score with TQ. Theoretically, sustainable finance and stakeholder engagement promote profitable growth in equity returns which enhance corporate performance. Policymakers, regulators, and governments should improve regulatory frameworks to ensure good ESG transparency in enhancing firm value. © 2021, Universiti Teknologi Mara. All rights reserved.},

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most Korean firms suffered unexpected difficulties in their business activities in early 2020, and their financial performance deteriorated significantly. The purpose of this study is to empirically analyze whether a firm’s ESG activities affect its financial performance during a business crisis. The results show that, in the first quarter of 2020, when the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, firms’ earnings dropped significantly; however, we found that the higher the performance of ESG activities, the smaller the decline in earnings. The results imply that, in an environment of uncertainty, the performance of a firm’s ESG activities is reflected in its financial outcomes. This result implies that trust and bond between firms and stakeholders, as formed through investments in social capital, are rewarded when the overall level of sustainability in markets is negatively impacted. In addition, our results suggest that the performance of nonfinancial activities is useful information for stakeholders’ decision making in relation to market uncertainty. © 2021 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: This analysis is based on a sample of companies listed on the Milan Italian Stock Exchange from the Financial Times Milan Stock Exchange Index over the 2016–2020 period. Regression analysis was used by using data retrieved from the Refinitiv Eikon database and the sample firms’ remuneration reports. Findings: The findings of this paper show that embedding sustainability in executive compensation positively affects firms’ non-financial performance. The results of this paper also reveal that specific corporate governance features can improve the impact of sustainability on non-financial performance. Research limitations/implications: This analysis is limited to Italian firms included in the Financial Times Milan Stock Exchange Index; however, the findings are highly significant. Practical implications: The findings provide regulators with useful insights for considering the integration of sustainability goals into executive remuneration. Another implication is that policymakers should require – at least – listed firms to fulfil specific corporate governance structural requirements. Finally, the findings can provide investors and financial analysts with a greater awareness of the role played by executive remuneration in the long-term value-creation process. Originality/value: This paper contributes to addressing the relationship among sustainability, remuneration and non-financial disclosure, drawing on the stakeholder–agency theoretical framework and focusing on Italian firms. This issue has received limited attention with controversial results in the literature. © 2022, Alex Almici.},

We find that automotive brands signal their ESG achievements in products, people, and a history of financial performance. These brands signal to consumers by communicating advertising spending, research and development investments, social media participation, ESG reputation, and appropriate linguistic styles. Automotive brands can signal ESG information for brand valuation directly and interactively through social media, the latter of which provides evidence of brand value co-creation. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

In this study, we explore whether maintaining higher ESG ratings reduces the systemic risks of firms in a stock market context. For this purpose we analyse the systemic risk indicators of the constituent stocks of S&P Europe 350 for the period of January 2016–September 2020, which also partly covers the COVID-19 period. We apply a VAR-MGARCH model to extract the volatilities and correlations of the return shocks of these stocks. Then, we obtain the systemic risk indicators by applying a principle components approach to the estimated volatilities and correlations. Our focus is on the impact of ESG ratings on systemic risk indicators, while we consider network centralities, volatilities and financial performance ratios as control variables. We use fixed effects and OLS methods for our regressions. Our results indicate that (1) the volatility of a stock’s returns and its centrality measures in the stock network are the main sources contributing to the systemic risk measure, (2) firms with higher ESG ratings face up to 7.3% less systemic risk contribution and exposure compared to firms with lower ESG ratings and (3) COVID-19 augmented the partial effects of volatility, centrality measures and some financial performance ratios. When considering only the COVID-19 period, we find that social and governance factors have statistically significant impacts on systemic risk. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Despite a large number of studies examining the relationship between corporate social responsibility disclosure (CSRD) and corporate financial performance (CFP), the literature remains inconclusive. Moreover, most of the studies are conducted in the context of American and European firms and remain scarce in the context of developing economies. To bridge this significant gap, this study attempts to investigate the strength of the relationship between CSRD and CFP of Indian firms. The study uses ESG (environmental, social and governance) score as a proxy for CSRD and investigates its relationship with both market-based and accounting-based financial performance measures for Indian companies. Both aggregate and disaggregate analyses based on industry type are carried out. The study includes a sample of 287 companies from the financial year 2014–2015 to 2018–2019 and employs panel data regression using pooled ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed effect and random effect model. The findings indicate that CSR disclosure has varying effects on CFP metrics. For industries—consumer goods, consumer services and heavy engineering, CSRD is positively associated with CFP, while for healthcare and energy and utility firms, the relationship between CSRD and CFP is negative. Overall, the type of industry, as well as the type of financial performance indicator, shows varying CSRD–CFP dynamics. The relevance of this study lies in the increasing importance of social responsibility and the growing contribution of emerging markets in international business. The study offers implications to assist policymakers, regulators and corporate managers in better understanding the CSRD–CFP structures in the context of a developing economy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Object: To analyze the relationship between Sustainable Culture, and the value drivers of open capital Brazilian listed companies in the period from 2006 to 2020. Theoretical framework: The theoretical framework mainly addresses topics such as sustainability, Corporate Sustainability Index, Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG), and Corporate Social Responsibility, as well as the relationships between environmental and financial performance in the business context. Method: The panel data regression model was used to analyze the data. Resultados e conclusão: The main results suggest that there is apparently a negative association between investment in ESG versus the financial performance of companies. However, a positive relationship was identified between the time of permanence in the ISE and the intangible assets of the firms, which may indicate the creation of value through a better institutional image before society. Implicações da pesquisa: The results show that being sustainable is expensive for companies and that, on the other hand, investing in sustainability seems to do companies' image good, indicating yet another strategic tool for firms in general. The importance of a sustainable corporate culture is evident, which has repercussions throughout society, in an agenda of global interest, aiming at environmental, organizational, and, consequently, social wellbeing. Originalidade/valor: This study is pioneering in suggesting a relationship between the time companies have been on the ISE and their intangible assets, analyzing the portfolio of that indicator since its inception. © 2022 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

The study uses publicly listed firms on the S&P Mid Cap 400, S&P 500, and the S&P Small Cap 600 Index. To accomplish the empirical analysis of this dissertation, two methods are used; the Fama & French portfolio formation method and a panel regression of operating performance (ROA) and firm value (Q) against ESG. The stock return analysis using Fama and French methodology is implemented by forming portfolios of firms with robust ESG scores and lower ESG scores using the top 10% of the S&P 1500 and the lowest 10% of companies. We find a negative alpha for both portfolios, which is less negative for the High ESG portfolio, displaying a link between ESG and CFP. The operating/firm value analysis uses annual data from 2010 - 2016 for 1,371 companies. ROA and Tobin's Q (dependent variables) are regressed on ESG, controlling for firm size and sales growth. A weak positive relationship is discovered between ROA, Q, and ESG. An agreement on the effect of sustainability factors on performance has not been established in the existing literature. Some studies indicate a positive link between sustainability factors. Alternate studies show an inverse connection. Still, various studies have unclear results or are absent from statistical influence. Consequently, this creates opportunities for further investigation on the subject.

Samples from global technology companies operating in three industry groups—computers, phones, and household electronics; software and information technology services; and telecommunications services—were collected. The Thomson Reuters ASSET4 database, covering the period of 2009–2017, was utilized for this study. The three CSR–ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) pillar scores were considered for comparison as independent X variables. The price-to-earnings ratio (PER) and Tobin’s Q values were used as dependent Y variables. In line with the view that CSR performance is linked to CFP (e.g., the dependence on governance of individual stakeholder’s groups and their proximity to end customers and/or consumers, their potential for social and environmental impacts, and their level of product service differentiation), the industry group classification and the regional and country levels of these 50 technology firms were used as controlling variables. Our recommendations to these companies are to improve their social, governance, and environmental aspects (in this order of priority) and to extend their CSR reach not just at the global–regional level but also within their national country frameworks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The final balanced sample comprises 7,081 firms, leading to 63,729 firm observations. This study finds that ESG factors play a vital role in enhancing CFP both for market (Tobin's Q) and accounting (return on assets and return on equity) indicators. This suggests that a firm with higher environmental and governance factors tends to increase its Tobin's Q in order to satisfy stakeholders' decision-making needs. The social factor has a negative and significant effect on CFP for market indicators and a negative but not significant effect on CFP for accounting indicators. This suggests that social factor drains the firm's resources, influence the firm's reputation, and may lead to competitive disadvantage. This study provides international comprehensive empirical evidence by investigating the impact of ESG's three factors separately as well as overall ESG disclosures' effect on CFP.

	abstract = {This study investigates the impact of environmental initiatives adopted by firms on wealth creation. A sample consisting primarily of 4886 developed and emerging market firms from Thomson Reuters ESG database is used for the study. Findings support that firms from emerging market had higher use of resources and emission reduction efficiency than the developed counterparts. Environmental initiatives were higher for polluting firms compared to non-polluting firms. Non-health sectors had higher environmental initiatives like efficient use of resources, emission reduction and innovation strategies targeted towards the reduction of environmental costs. Food sector had higher environmental initiatives compared to the non-food sector. Firms from sin industries had positive market valuation effects. Using regression analysis, our study examines the impact of environmental initiatives on three models of performance. The study suggests that environmental initiatives to reduce environmental emissions and activities targeted at environmental innovation are not value enhancing activities for entities. Empirical findings supporting that environmental initiatives do not lead to improved financial performance lead to have implications for managers and policy makers. With markets not perceiving environmental initiatives as value creating activities by firms, actions targeted towards emission reduction, adoption of environmental innovation strategies and resource efficiency are not positively viewed by markets.

The study is pioneering in the analysis of the transparency of non-financial information on the websites of companies listed on the main Spanish stock market index (IBEX 35). It uses exploratory and descriptive analysis to determine whether the companies with the best economic efficiency indicators are also the most transparent in non-financial indicators (ESG) and to what extent these relationships explain the dependency between the two. The findings reveal that IBEX35 companies need to improve their web transparency by presenting solid non-financial reports with ESG sustainability parameters. The results show that companies with economic profitability in Return on Assets that use their debt levels wisely disclose higher levels of ESG information. In other words, financial performance and indebtedness contribute to improving levels of ESG disclosure on the IBEX35. Companies must also improve accessibility to ESG information, update it, and classify it in accordance with current regulations. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The aims of this study are threefold. Firstly, it examines the long-term improvement in the corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Secondly, it highlights the favourable financial implications of the higher corporate ESG performance disclosure. The third aim is to provide insight into the industrial impact on the relationship between corporate ESG performance disclosure and financial performance. This study uses a sample of all Australian publicly listed companies between 2007 and 2017 and conducts a panel regression analysis. It also performs several robustness checks to address the methodological, sample selection and endogeneity issues concerning corporate ESG performance disclosure. The findings show a tangible improvement in Australian companies' corporate ESG performance disclosure, favourably associated with financial performance. However, while the corporate ESG performance disclosure appears to be linked to higher financial performance, this is not the case across different industries. The industrial impact on the association between corporate ESG performance disclosure and financial performance has several implications. Firstly, the stakeholders' pressure on companies to address ESG-related concerns is substantial, enhancing corporate financial performance. Secondly, the findings indicate that corporate ESG performance disclosure does not benefit corporations in different industry sectors equally. It, therefore, requires more focus and interpretation by corporate decision-makers. Thirdly, by promoting ESG-related disclosure, managers should consider diverse stakeholders in different industries that weigh business objectives differently. The results of this study provide insights for corporate managers regarding prioritising resource allocations to ESG-related activities that could impact financial performance differently in different industry sectors. The results of this study contribute to the growing literature on the financial implications of corporate ESG performance disclosures, notably different industrial characteristics.4. © 2022, University of Wollongong.

Design/methodology/approach: The study covers a sample selection of observations for a total of 152 firm-years for 39 financial companies within the Nordic region (Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway) for the business years including 2015–2019. Data regarding ESG and FP indicators were extracted from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database in July 2020. This is a quantitative study using regression and a generalized method of moments. Findings: Using static and dynamic estimators, the authors found both positive and negative impacts of sustainability practice on FP. The authors identified a negative relationship between ESG practices and FP (return on invested capital, return on equity and earnings per share). The authors identified a positive relationship between governance and return on assets. Originality/value: A key contribution to the accounting literature is the finding that there is a risk for financial firms in adopting sustainability practices, as they follow a logic that contradicts the purely economic rationale. On the other hand, the positive relationship between governance and FP helps not only companies but also regulators and researchers to understand the positive impact of a good governance structure. © 2021, ABM Fazle Rahi, Ruzlin Akter and Jeaneth Johansson.},

	abstract = {This paper goes beyond the relationship between a bank ESG performance (ESGP) and corporate financial performance (CFP). Here, the link between ESG factors and financial benchmarks is analysed to verify whether banks may find in the market reaction sufficient stimuli (higher CFP) to adopt ESG conduct spontaneously. Using panel estimation methods on European banks listed in STOXX Europe 600, between 2008 and 2019, this paper tests the relationship between ESGP and CFP considering different dimensions of financial performance at once, both accounted-based (ROA and ROE) and market-based (Capitalisation to Book Value, Tobin's Q). Besides, we employ VBM (EVA Spread) not previously considered. The main findings support the current approach of banking authorities, focusing on bank ESG risks, more than ESG opportunities, in order to “force” banks into adopting a new ESG business model, at this early stage of transition to sustainability. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Socially and environmentally responsible investing is becoming the benchmark in financial markets. Promoting emerging industries’ environmental performance, social responsibility, and corporate governance (ESG) ratings are increasingly becoming the consensus of multinational green financial institutions, investors, and governments. This study employs 3100 panel data from 2014 to 2019 to conduct empirical research on green innovation, ESG indicators, and the financial performance of China’s Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) listed companies. Based on the “causal steps approach”, we adopt the Sobel–goodman and Bootstrap test to explore the partial mediation effect of ESG indicators. Moreover, when testing the interactive effect of endogeneity, instrumental variables combined with two-stage least squares (2SLS) and a general method of moments (GMM) system are applied in the dynamic panel for robustness. Combing with the approach of ESG factors-integrated and ESG factors-embedded regression models, we find that: (1) Green innovation can significantly improve the ESG scores of GEM listed companies. (2) Both green innovation and ESG performance can improve the financial performances of GEM listed companies, and ESG performance plays an indirect mediating role in the promotion of green innovation on financial performance. (3) Both political connection strength and regional innovation capabilities can negatively moderate the promotion of green innovation on financial performance, and moderating the effect of corporate political connections is more significant than the regional innovation. This study expands the research on the effectiveness of ESG indices and green innovation from the view of micro-GEM companies, providing policy enlightenment for the sustainable development of emerging industries. Our findings provide noteworthy implications for regulators, academicians and practitioners interested in exploring green innovation, ESG rating and financial performance. In addition, providing regulators and the board of directors with insights into the company’s and country’s future growth prospects. © 2022 by the authors.},

Moreover, the study makes a novel contribution to existing ESG and performance-based studies by exploring the explanatory effects of ESG and firm performance over ten years. In addition, the study discusses the ESG-performance link of SMEs, thus advancing existing knowledge related to ESG in respect of SME performance. The study uses an extensive Australian sample from Bloomberg’s database from 2007 to 2017, while panel regression analysis is applied to investigate the relationship between a firm’s ESG performance and profitability. The robustness of the results is evaluated after incorporating several robustness checks to address methodological, endogeneity and causality issues related to a firm’s ESG performance disclosure. The empirical findings of this study suggest that improving a firm’s ESG performance is beneficial to all stakeholders of large firms in the long run but not for SME companies. The theoretical model suggests that listed SMEs do not disclose their ESG activities for various reasons, such as a lack of necessary resources. Specifically, the study extends scholarly understanding of existing theory and discusses the significance of the findings for future research. © 2022 by the authors.

Research in this field has focused on specific topics, such as the financial performance of sustainable investments and companies committed to sustainability. The SFI literature is excessively fragmented, rendering it difficult to identify what constitutes the field and what differentiates it from traditional finance and investment. Based on a systematic literature review of 166 articles, we map and integrate the main elements of the SFI field and identify the most relevant avenues for further research. In this process, we provide a definition of SFI; identify the main players in the field; and describe their profiles, strategies, and outcomes. We also propose a framework for understanding the SFI field and a research agenda. This agenda organizes the main SFI research questions and suggests suitable approaches to address them. We conclude that SFI players have worked together to promote positive social and environmental impacts through their financial and investment activities. However, the under-theorization of the SFI concept, the traditional short-term nature of financial logic, and the lack of evidence on the SFI impacts on society and the environment are the greatest challenges facing the field. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

This paper discusses research progress as well as various issues and complexities associated with using ESG ratings in cross-country studies and for assessing the performance of multinational enterprises (MNE) and emerging market multinationals (EMNEs). Design/methodology/approach: The paper identifies emerging literature that focuses on tracking the development and uptake of ESG ratings in the international context. It discusses three emerging research streams: Research examining the ESG-financial performance relationship in emerging markets, research tracking the ESG performance of multinationals in the various countries and regions they are operating, and frameworks for assessing ESG-related risks on a country level. Findings: While the emerging body of work adds an important dimension to the identification and awareness of ESG issues globally, numerous unresolved issues become evident. ESG frameworks have been built to assess corporate sustainability as it relates to firms in their “home” countries (typically with a focus on developed countries), with limited applicability and transferability to emerging markets. International firm activities are often not captured in detail and not comprehensively mapped across firm subsidiaries and a firm’s corporate supply chain where ESG issues are prone to happen, and ESG scores do not comprehensively integrate views and voices from various local stakeholders that are impacted by firm activities, particularly indigenous communities. Research limitations/implications: Research on ESG ratings in the context of multinational business research is generally sparse and fragmented, thus creating opportunities for future research to expand on existing and emerging findings. Practical implications: The paper creates awareness of issues to consider when using ESG ratings in cross-country studies and for assessing the ESG performance of MNEs and EMNEs: ESG scores can be subject to bias and are not weighted by materiality, which can be misleading for portfolio construction and performance measurement purposes. Managers need to be aware that ESG scores are often not capturing ESG issues occurring in supply chains and ESG issues affecting local communities. Originality/value: This study enriches the understanding of ESG in the context of multinational business research practice. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Clustering is a long and widely-used technique to group similar objects based on their distance. Recently, it has been found that this grouping exercise can be enhanced if the preference information of a decision-maker is taken into account. Consequently, new multi-criteria clustering methods have been proposed. All proposed algorithms are based on the non-hierarchical clustering approach, in which the number of clusters is known in advance. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical multi-criteria clustering that is based on PROMETHEE, where the number of clusters does not need to be specified. Because the outcome is dependent on the parameters of PROMETHEE, we take into account uncertainty and imprecision by enhancing our approach making use of the Stochastic Multiobjective Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) and cluster ensemble methods. SMAA is used to generate a large number of solutions by randomly varying the PROMETHEE parameters, followed by the use of ensemble clustering, which reaches a consensus solution. Our new approach is illustrated in a clustering study of the performance evaluation of US banks according to a set of financial and non-financial (environmental, social and corporate governance; ESG) criteria. We find that established banks appear in the overall best-performing clusters, with more contemporary banks following suit. In additional analysis we compare financial and overall (financial and non-financial) performance and find a mixed appreciation of the ESG aspects in this industry in the middle clusters. © 2020},

Despite the limitations of the existing measures, they are still being commonly used. The literature finds that the relationship between performance and corporate governance quality can be positive, non-existing or even negative. To resolve this puzzle, we introduce a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach to construct an alternative corporate governance quality synthesising companies’ practices and mechanisms through an exhaustive pair comparison procedures based on outranking relationships analysis. Our approach compares the aggregate quality with a well-known corporate governance index, ASSET4 ESG in Thomson Reuters Datastream, using data for the US firms. Using this MCDA approach based on PROMETHEE methods and econometric analysis, we obtain consistently a negative and strong link between firm performance and corporate governance quality.

	abstract = {Research Question/Issue: We examine the impact of two differing types of employee board representation (i.e., labor board representation and employee shareholder board representations) on environmental, social, and corporate governance components of ESG performance and the moderating role of each type of employee board representation on the relationship between ESG performance and the firm's market value. Research Findings/Insights: Using a propensity score matching approach on a sample of French firms listed in the SBF 120 index from 2007 to 2017, our findings reveal that labor board representatives act in the opposite direction to employee shareholder board representatives by focusing exclusively on improving social performance and reducing environmental and corporate governance performance. The way employees are represented on the board of directors also moderates the corporate ESG–financial performance relationship differently. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Employee directors are not a homogenous group. The differentiation between the two types of employee directors (i.e., labor board representatives and employee shareholder board representatives) brings a deeper understanding of the effect of stakeholders' representation on the board. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our results are of interest to governance policymakers because they provide them with a fresh understanding of the key role of employee board representation. A meaningful inference to be drawn from our findings is that employee ownership and the representation of employees on the board as employee shareholders may bring about fundamental changes in employees' attitudes and behavior on the board and may, in this regard, be considered as a credible way of generating social harmony and constructive relationships between employees and shareholders.

	abstract = {Sustainability reporting is the counterpart of the concept of non-financial reporting and an important element of integrated reporting that includes financial and non-financial information (GRI) 3. Integrated Reporting is described as a summary presentation of how an organization’s strategy, management, performance, and expectations will create value (IIRC) 4. In integrated reporting, the information collected from different sources of institutions (finance, ecology, etc.) is established and evaluated, and uncertainties regarding the future activities of organizations are tried to be prevented and their sustainability is evaluated (Vaz et al. (2016)). This study works out the impact of gender diversity on companies’ boards of directors on the quality of Integrated Reporting and firm performance. 15 companies that have ESG scores between 2014 and 2019 from 56 companies included in the ISE Sustainability Index (XUSRD) as of 03.02.2020 have been examined and reported using the Panel Data Analysis method. The ISE Sustainability Index allows investors to easily distinguish companies that develop sustainability and corporate social responsibility principles and invest in these companies. It also allows companies to compare their corporate sustainability performance locally and globally. For this reason, this index, which aims to increase understanding, knowledge, and practices on sustainability among ISE companies, is very important and it has been observed that the relationship between women on board of directors, firm performance, and ESG is not analyzed adequately. © 2020, Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The topic has been of much interest to researchers and policymakers due to increased awareness among stakeholders on the adverse social and environmental impacts of business actions. Using a dataset covering 5 years for 62 MFIs across 34 countries, we find that environmental and governance performance has no impact on the financial performance of MFIs. As for the social–financial performance nexus, our results reveal a positive relationship using the depth of outreach as proxy of social performance. However, when women empowerment is used as a proxy for social performance, evidence suggest presence of negative relationship. The study contributes to the literature by providing new evidence on the relationship between environmental, social, and governance and financial performance from microfinance industry.

	abstract = {We study behind-the-scenes investor activism promoting environmental, social, and governance (ESG) improvements by means of a proprietary dataset of a large international, socially responsible activist fund. We examine the activist’s target selection, forms of engagement, impact on ESG performance, drivers of success, and effects on the targets’ operations and value creation. Target firms are typically large and visible, perform well, and have high liquidity (stock turnover) and low ESG performance. Engagement induces ESG rating adjustments: firms with poor ex ante ESG ratings experience a ratings increase after complying with the activist’s demands, whereas firms with high ex ante ESG ratings experience a ratings decrease following the revelation of their ESG problems. Activism that is focused on environmental and social issues is more likely to succeed if targets are ESG-sensitive (i.e., they have a strong ex ante ESG profile). Successful engagements boost targets’ sales. Risk-adjusted excess stock returns (with four-factor adjustment and relative to a matched sample of non-engaged firms) of successful engagements outperform those of unsuccessful engagements by 2.7%. Results are especially strong for firms with low ex ante ESG scores. Specifically, targeted firms in the lowest ex ante ESG quartile outperform matched peers by 7.5% in the year after the end of the engagement. Our results thus suggest that the activism regarding corporate social responsibility generally improves ESG practices and corporate sales and is profitable to the activist. Taken together, we provide direct evidence that ethical investing and strong financial performance, both from the activist’s and the targeted firm’s perspective, can go hand-in-hand together. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Environmentally friendly activities have the greatest effect on bank value. We examine the channels through which ESG activity impacts bank value and find a positive relationship between ESG activity and both cash flows and efficiency.

However, these have often struggled to show that positive correlations—when produced—can in fact explain the behavior. The authors of this article provide a link between ESG information and the valuation and performance of companies, by examining three transmission channels within a standard discounted cash flow model—which they call the cash-flow channel, the idiosyncratic risk channel, and the valuation channel. They tested each of these transmission channels using MSCI ESG Ratings data and financial variables. This showed that companies’ ESG information was transmitted to their valuation and performance, both through their systematic risk profile (lower costs of capital and higher valuations) and their idiosyncratic risk profile (higher profitability and lower exposures to tail risk). The research suggests that changes in a company’s ESG characteristics may be a useful financial indicator. ESG ratings may also be suitable for integration into policy benchmarks and financial analyses. © 2019 Portfolio Management Research. All rights reserved.},

In this study, we treat a firm's ESG score as a demonstration of strategic choice in the level of transparency that results in increased firm performance as measured by Tobin's Q and return on assets. Performance differences are a result of choice moderated by the size of the firm as measured by employees and sales. We analyze 467 firms in the S&P 500 from 2009 to 2015. Applying legitimacy and stakeholder theory, we find that there is significant difference between groups with respect to disclosure and performance. The results of quartile analysis by sales, capitalization, and Tobin's Q are relevant to understand the influence that the ESG score has on financial performance. ESG influences on Tobin's Q are greatest for large firms as measured by sales, as opposed to the ESG affects on Tobin's Q and return on asset for smallest firms as measured by market capitalization. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

To test the moderating effect of the board characteristics in the relationship between CSR practices and financial performance, we applied linear regressions with panel data using the Thomson Reuters ASSET4 database from European countries in analyzing data of 225 listed companies between 2015 and 2019. The results show that board characteristics partially moderate the relationship between CSR practices and financial performance in European ESG firms. In addition, this study indicates that CSR practices affect the firm’s financial performance positively. The study findings appended a new dimension to governance research that could provide policymakers and regulators with a valuable source of information to strengthen governance mechanisms for better financial performance. Previous studies mostly investigate the direct effect of corporate governance on financial performance. A few studies examine the moderating effect of CSR practice.

Design/methodology/approach: The final sample includes firms listed on the German Prime Standard (DAX30, MDAX and TecDAX) from 2015 to 2019. The study includes a correlation and regression analysis using fixed effects on 363 firm-year observations to investigate the CSP-CFP relationship. This paper applies accounting and market-based CFP measures and uses Thomson Reuters (TR) ESG scores to measure CSP. Findings: Overall CSP, social pillar and governance pillar performance improve CFP for firms listed on the German Prime Standard. However, the study provides evidence for a value-destroying effect of CSP over-investment in the social pillar. Research limitations/implications: The implications of the study are ambiguous. First, firms can improve CFP when doing good, i.e. increase CSP. Second, however, CSP is a concept of decreasing marginal benefits. Consequently, managers can respond to increasing pressure from investors to be “sustainable” with the argument of CSP over-investment. Policymakers must consider materiality as a potential explanation for the over-investment phenomena when framing sustainable development programs, i.e. the EU Green Deal and regulations such as the Directive 2014/95/EU and the Regulation EU 2020/852. Moreover, the study sensitizes society that sustainability efforts do not exclusively affect CFP positively. Originality/value: The paper contributes to CSP literature by revisiting the CSP-CFP relationship and debuting a CSP over-investment hypothesis on the German market. The results are highly relevant for practitioners, policymakers and society, as the study provides an empirical framework to evaluate CSP properly and reveals the importance of materiality in stakeholder management. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {There is a growing interest in assessing environmental performance, social responsibility, and corporate governance (ESG) in the banking sector. Also, significant relationships are expected between ESG dimensions and corporate financial performance. The purpose of this research is to analyze the relationships between ten dimensions of the environmental, social, and governance pillars and bank financial performance, for the decade after the 2008 financial crisis. Data was collected from the Refinitiv database for 39 European banks, for the period 2010–2019. Our results show a positive relationship between emission reductions and financial performance. However, a bank's accounting and market performance may be at odds with its product quality and social responsibility policies. Moreover, an increase in the quality of a bank's corporate governance system was found to negatively affect company financial performance. Our results have multiple theoretical implications. The predictions related to stakeholder theory and the resource-based view were confirmed, as banks show interest in resource efficiency, environment-aware products and services, and process digitization. On the other hand, the prediction of stakeholder theory regarding the positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance was rejected. Also, corporate governance quality has a negative contribution to accounting performance and market valuation, going against the hypotheses of agency theory. This could mean that market investors do not value a bank's involvement in social responsibility initiatives and do not endorse the adoption of best governance practices that could reduce the riskiness of a bank's portfolio. These findings have practical implications for bank managers and company boards in selecting and disclosing ESG policies and initiatives. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Environment, social, and governance (ESG) actions of companies have come to represent key elements in adopting decisions by stakeholders. The question is to what extent they validate the companies' environmental behaviour, as profitability varies over time. The answer can be obtained by analysing the relationship between environmental performance (EP) and financial performance (FP) of the firms. The paper proposes a new perspective of this relationship, namely, the separate assessment of the EP-FP in the case of positive and negative FP (expressed through accounting returns). A survey on 299 companies in the European Economic Area (EEA), operating in extractives and minerals processing and health care, was conducted. The data were extracted from the Refinitiv database for the period 2009-2018. The findings showed a significant EP-FP correlation in the case of the extractives and minerals processing industry, but their dependency slightly varied on the positive and negative returns' scenario. As for the healthcare industry, the best result was a moderate correlation between EP and the negative return. Our findings support a managerial design of environmental policy, as well as the future academic research of the EP-FP relationship. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This article aims to detect how ESG adds value to the long-term shareholder value creation and to discover whether businesses are aware of positive ESG effects and, therefore, whether they will become more ESG-conscious. By conducting a qualitative content analysis on the academic literature, this article firstly aims to determine if shareholders’ value is positively affected by corporate ESG awareness. Secondly, to test whether companies are becoming more conscious about the importance of ESG, the mission statements of publicly listed Central and Eastern European (CEE) companies are compared to their decade-old versions. This analysis allows us to conclude on whether companies have shifted their attention to the ESG factors as a part of their purpose of existence and, therefore, for long-term shareholder value creation, which is one of the main goals of the exchange-listed enterprises. The content analysis results show that companies with higher sustainability awareness ensure shareholder value creation via improved financial performance, management quality as well as reduced risk metrics. Additionally, qualitative nonfinancial factors such as reputation, stakeholder trust, employee satisfaction and engagement provide an even more significant effect on the long-term value than the pure financial matters. The theoretical trend is found to be supported by the fact that sustainability practice and consumer-oriented keywords dominate the mission statements of CEE companies, while keywords related to shareholders and profit experienced the most significant decrease from 2012 to 2021. The present research is unique as it looks at how companies tend to become more ESG aware, integrating the sustainability perspective into their mission statements in response to the global sustainability trend. © 2021 by the authors.

It contrasts the results with two other African stock exchanges (Nigeria and Egypt with no mandatory <IR>) and examines whether <IR> quality also has an impact on these and on environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure scores. Design/methodology/approach: A series of multivariate ordinary least squares regressions was estimated on a range of financial, risk, institutional and ESG data from firms on the three African stock exchanges, between 2006 and 2015. Findings: Financial performance and risk in South African firms appear to have decreased since the start of mandatory reporting, but institutional shareholding has increased. The production of higher quality reports is associated with decreased financial performance and risk, higher institutional shareholding and increased ESG scores. Originality/value: This study is first to test the quantitative effects of <IR> and <IR> quality on a broad range of financial performance and risk measures and the level of institutional shareholding. It also adds to the literature by assessing how the quality of <IR> can impact the ESG scoring of the business. Hence, this study is of interest to firms looking to adopt <IR> for its benefits and to regulatory bodies considering the mandatory adoption of <IR> in support of achievement of national social and environmental goals. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The empirical study involved the use of linear regressions and processing by a program specialized in statistics and data science (Stata), and emphasizes the impact of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on Romanian banks and the opportunity to implement them in their own risk management strategies. For this purpose, were considered independent variables, at the microeconomic level: return on assets, the leverage multiplier, the credit-deposit ratio, the number of members of the management body, and at the macroeconomic level: the unemployment rate, the inflation rate and the growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product. The dependent variable used was the dummy variable called ESG. The results of our research show that, as the return on assets or the leverage multiplier increases, the probability that the bank implements a risk management strategy associated with environmental, social and governance factors decreases, and the number of members of the management body positively impacts the decision to get involved in social responsibility activities. Through this research was assessed the opportunity to integrate the risks associated with sustainable development within the strategies of development and risk management at the level of financial intermediaries and the importance of standardizing sustainable practices throughout the entire banking system in Romania. © 2020.},

Results indicated that ESG initiatives have a significant positive to the firm performance. The presence of independent board members and ownership by investors is a positive determinant for value creation. The adoption of best practice corporate governance principles is an important determinant of the valuation of firms. Firms' propensity to use defence mechanisms decreases valuation effects.

	abstract = {Voluntary non-financial reporting aims at fairly reporting a firm’s non-financial performance. In particular, integrated reporting (IR) displays in a single report the contribution of different forms of capital to the firm’s value creation. Drawing on both legitimacy and voluntary disclosure theory, the main purpose of this study is to examine the extent to which a company’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance affects the content and semantic properties of intellectual capital disclosure (ICD) found in IRs. To test theoretical hypotheses, content and tone analysis is used to assess the disclosure strategy associated with ICD, whereas a regression analysis tests the variation in semantic properties of ICD according to firms’ ESG performance. A total of 79 reports by European listed firms from 2011 to 2016 were downloaded via the Integrated Reporting Emerging Practice Examples Database and analyzed. Results show that ESG performance contributing more to optimistic ICD tone is governance, although in mixed ways. Integrating vision and strategy positively contributes to ICD tone, whereas information on poor treatment of shareholders’ rights tends to be manipulated and associated with an optimistic tone of the ICD. Moreover, eco-efficient product innovation and healthy and safe job conditions play a positive role in enhancing optimistic ICD tone. This chapter contributes to the current literature on voluntary disclosure by introducing new evidence on the disclosure strategy in IR. By analyzing the effect of the single dimensions of ESG performance on ICD tone, this study extends respectively ESG literature. © 2020 by Emerald Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {In this article, we investigate the notion of doing well while doing good from the perspective of passive portfolio strategies. We analyze a number of asset allocation strategies based on ESGweighting and compare their financial and ESG performance for the US and Europe. We find no significant difference in the financial performance but superior ESG performance of ESG-based strategies. It can be concluded that, compared to a naive strategy, socially responsible investors are willing to pay a small premium for the impact of the portfolio via transaction costs when rebalancing the portfolio according to their preferences for social responsibility. In addition, when comparing the ESG-based strategies to a value-weighted strategy, we observe no significant difference in ESG performance but a high degree of significance in the superior financial performance of the ESG-based strategy. We also analyze the strategies with regards to the factor loadings given by the Fama–French five-factor model and a sixth factor denoted GMB (Good minus Bad) and find significant differences across the regions and strategies. Overall, the results show strong support of ESG-based strategies being preferred by socially responsible investors but also suggest that such strategies might be preferred by conventional investors looking for a passively managed alternative compared to a valueweighted index. Furthermore, it seems that such a strategy might be a more adequate benchmark for active SRI funds. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing is a form of socially responsible investing promoting sustainability. ESG ratings quantitatively measure the sustainable practices of companies, with lower ratings meaning more sustainable practices adopted. With the goal of contributing to United Nations' sustainable development goal number 17, first, we present a methodology for creating a dataset that houses both ESG and financial parameters of publicly listed companies worldwide. Second, we present a framework for conducting statistical analysis and leveraging machine learning techniques to gauge the importance of ESG parameters for investment decisions and how they affect financial performance of firms. For companies with the best ESG ratings, 'return on equity' was found to be greater than rest of the companies. While using linear and random forest regression models, prediction accuracy of growth variables 'profit margin' and 'return on assets' increased when ESG data was used along with financial data as input. Companies having the highest 'profit margins' were the ones having the best ESG ratings. With this study, we hope to bolster worldwide collaboration for sustainable development.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Since such scandals call attention to activities harmful to sustainable development, it is very important to study the relationships between concerns for sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), sustainability, and organisations’ market value. The added value of our study is, first, to explore SSCM controversies as drivers of or pressures for adopting and applying sustainability practices; and, second, to contribute to the recent but growing literature that analyses the channels through which SSCM and sustainability practices influence the firm’s value. We introduce sustainability environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices as a mediator between SSCM controversies and market value to examine whether SSCM controversies with firms’ stakeholders lead to improvements in the ESG dimensions of organisational sustainability. We also examine the relationships between the ESG dimensions and market value, measured as Tobin’s Q ratio. The results confirm both the positive relationships of SSCM controversies to the ESG dimensions two years later and a positive relationship of the dimension of governance to Tobin’s Q. We also confirm a negative and significant relationship of the social dimension to Tobin’s Q, and a non-significant relationship of the environmental dimension to Tobin’s Q. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Based on stakeholder and upper echelons theory, this study aims to analyze whether the link between environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance and financial performance is moderated by chief executive officer (CEO) power. Design/methodology/approach: Listed corporations with reference to the German two-tier system (HDAX and SDAX) for the business years 2010-2018 (775 firm-year observations) have been included. Fixed effects panel regression analysis was conducted to analyze the link between ESG performance (in total and its three pillars) and financial performance (ROA), with special reference to the interaction of a CEO power index. Findings: While ESG performance has a positive impact on financial performance, the link is more pronounced by CEO power. Thus, in line with prior research on the one-tier system, CEO incentives can positively contribute to the CSR-business case in the German two-tier system. The results remain constant after conducting several robustness checks. Originality/value: A key contribution to the empirical CSR literature can be stated, as the moderating role of CEO power in the ESG–financial performance link is rather neglected in prior studies. Thus, corporate governance and sustainability should be classified as interactive aspects for the business case of a successful stakeholder management. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We contribute to the literature by considering firms active in sustainable innovations by obtaining green patents. We also contribute to the literature by using disaggregated measures of environmental performance collected from the Bloomberg ESG database, including environmental disclosure score, greenhouse gas emissions, waste emissions and water use. Panel data regressions' results show that environmental transparency positively influences current accounting and stock market performance, but negatively influences the return on capital employed. Furthermore, lower pollution emissions tend to improve the current return on assets, while being harmful for the efficiency of long-term capital employment at the same time. The empirical results also indicate that the Global Financial Crisis (2007–2010) increased the environmental transparency of firms with green patents but negatively impacted their price to earnings ratio. At the same time, lower waste disposal diminishes stock valuation while the opposite is true with water use. Taken together, our results suggest that environmental transparency and greenhouse gas emissions generally appear to be the most important environmental variables influencing financial performance, with increasing importance attributed to them by the market after the global crisis period. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

This paper develops a rough set model to relate ESG scores to popular corporate financial performance measures. This methodology permits handling with information in an uncertain, ambiguous, and imperfect context. A large database was gathered, including ESG scores, as well as industry sector and financial variables for publicly traded European companies during the period 2013-2018. We carried out 500 simulations of the rough set model for different values in the discretization parameter and different grouping scenarios of firms regarding ESG scores. The results suggest that the variables considered are useful in the prediction of ESG rank when firms are clustered in three or four equally balanced groups. However, the prediction power vanishes when a larger number of groups is computed. This would suggest that industry sector and financial variables serve to find big differences across firms regarding ESG, but the significance of the model drops when small differences in ESG performance are scrutinized. © 2020 by the authors.},

Therefore, we examine the sustainability performance using both ESG criteria and the alignment of products and services with the Sustainable Development Goals. Our results show that the DAX 50 ESG may only to a limited extent be promoted as the most sustainable German index. Moreover, since inception as well as during the COVID-19 crisis, the DAX 50 ESG’s financial performance is comparatively worse. Our findings suggest that stock markets penalize the inclusion of a firm in the DAX 50 ESG in the short run, thus affecting the overall index performance.

	abstract = {Increasing interest in sustainability performance (environmental, social, and governance pillar performance [ESGP]) and corporate financial performance (CFP) is noteworthy. However, we do not find any all-inclusive study that employs both individual components of environmental, social, and governance pillars (ESG) as well as the cumulative ESG score on both the accounting and market performance of firms. Furthermore, we do not find any study that puts forth “best practices” in the ESGP-CFP nexus. Therefore, our study intends to provide additional empirical evidence in this debate by including all three pillars of ESG as well as the overall ESG score by employing a unique sample of “100 best corporate citizens” in the United States declared by 3BL Media during 2009 to 2018. For this purpose, we employ panel vector auto regression (PVAR) that allows us to overcome the methodological challenges faced by some earlier empirical studies. The core findings are: (a) for market-based financial performance (market-to-book ratio [MTB] and Tobin’s Q), our results only confirm ESGP–CFP relationship and suggest that sustained higher commitment to the environmental pillar, consistent socially responsible conduct, and rationalized governance mechanism of the sampled firms are perceived value additive by the market players. (b) For accounting-based financial performance (return on equity [ROE] and return on assets [ROA]), we find a mix of ESGP–CFP and CFP–ESGP relationship for ROE only. Furthermore, factor error variance decomposition (FEVD) analysis reveals that environmental, social, and overall ESG performances of the sampled firms are quite good predictors of future CFP in the market. These findings assert that actively pursuing ESG endeavors can assist firms in achieving superior financial performance. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Shifting from short-term profit maximizing strategies to more sustainable long-term ones, the corporate world has been exerting extra effort to adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performances. However, the loop question remains unsolved: is ESG financially-driven or is financial performance (FIN) ESG-driven? Building on the slack resources theory and bridging three management literatures, this analysis relies on a six-year panel dataset of multinational organizations from different industries. A distributed lag regression model is proposed to empirically investigate the impact of FIN performance on ESG and to test the moderator effect of total quality management (TQM). The findings reveal a stimulus effect between free cash flow (FCF) and ESG scores. While the interaction between TQM and FCF has a negative effect on ESG, the interaction between TQM and Tobin’s Q reveals a positive relationship with ESG. This study sheds further insights for both research and practice towards the operationalization of sustainability management. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The results show that, in line with expectations, companies that comply with ESG principles demonstrate significantly better financial performance than other companies. This result holds true irrespective of the performance indicator used. Moreover, the governance factor is strongly related to company performance, providing implications for companies' policymakers in terms of the utility of adopting ESG information.

The research objective of the present paper is to analyse the sustainability of stock exchanges based on the construction of an original multi-variate composite index in order to explore the links with business-specific and national environment indicators. We conducted our global study on 92 eligible out of a total of 96 available stock exchanges on the Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative (SSE) platform at the end of August 2019. The overall sustainability index of stock exchanges (SustyEx) was developed by successively applying the Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CATPCA) at pillar and aggregated levels. The three-grouping solution highlighted the inclusion of most of the investigated stock exchanges in the initial sustainability development stage. The sustainability achievements of stock exchanges are frequently associated with their internal and external economic performance. © 2020, Bucharest University of Economic Studies.

Data were collected from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database for the H&T firms listed there between 2011 and 2018. We employed panel data analysis, after which we ran robustness tests. The results indicated that having a CSR committee and female directors on the board are robust factors driving firms to show superior CSR performance in all dimensions, including environmental, social, and governance (ESG). Independent directors and directors' diligence selectively enhance the overall CSR score and individual pillars of CSR. Investigating the relationship between CSR performance and firms' financial performance did not produce a significant outcome. The findings propose a straightforward roadmap for H&T firms and policymakers to identify characteristics of CSR-friendly boards. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Nevertheless, we still know little about how and whether corporate controversies, which are strictly related to CSR, impact firm performance. As a result, this study aims to explore the impact of corporate controversies on financial performance, and proposes the positive moderating role of ESG practices over the aforementioned relationship. Using a database of 356 European listed companies, linear regression models confirm a negative and significant relationship between corporate controversies and financial performance. However it was not possible to confirm the positive moderating effect of ESG practices on the relationship between controversies and financial performance. The study contributes to the literature on CSR and stakeholder theory, shedding light on the negative consequences of controversies and indicating that, despite no mitigating effects of ESG practices on the controversies/performance relationship have been found, ESG practices are important for addressing stakeholders’ needs. Regarding managerial implications, this study underlines that controversies are detrimental for firm performance, and that ESG practices should not serve as means for mitigating the negative effects of controversies, but rather as ways for avoiding controversies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has evolved from simple philanthropy to a more theoretical concept with a new corporate philosophy that takes all the interests of all stakeholders into consideration. The financial market is pushing the development of Socially Responsible Investment (SRI), which has led to the rise of Corporate Sustainability Systems (CSS). These CSSs are tools that rate corporate performance on sustainability. However, they constitute a chaotic universe, with instruments of different nature. This paper identifies and groups the common characteristics of the CSSs into three different typologies: Indexes, Rankings and Ratings. Despite this classification, and although the fundamental pillar of CSR is the "Stakeholder Theory", CSSs are still not ideal tools to be used by all stakeholders. From the magma of CSSs, this article identifies and describes, through a comparative analysis, those which best comply with the "Stakeholder Theory". This paper facilitates the work of researchers and stakeholders by exposing the differential characteristics of the most important CSSs. © 2020 by the authors.},

The institutional difference hypothesis (IDH) suggests that institutional weaknesses in emerging markets affect the relationship between financial performance and corporate social performance (CSP) of companies. This can occur because, under such circumstances, firms are more likely to prioritize the capital accumulation and not recognize the potential strategic benefit of socially responsible investments. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a regression analysis of panel data study comprising 2,165 companies from developed and emerging countries, covering the period between 2007 and 2014. Our results suggest that there is a prevalence of the institutional environment in relation to the financial and ESG performances of companies.

Even though, from an ethical point of view, sustainability can be well-founded on human rights and civic ethics, our goal in this paper has been to sustain and enrich business sustainability based on the Social Doctrine of the Catholic Church, which can be shared in its advises by many non-Catholic people, as it is a rich source of wisdom. We have also studied its economic logic; analyzing why it is justified for sustainable companies to obtain good results, formulating the model to alleviate the agency problem (which allows it to overcome the traditional stakeholder model), studying empirical analyses that demonstrate the good financial performance of sustainable companies, and making a new analysis that confirms the above. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, the authors investigate a firm’s decision to provide a CSR report, and if so, whether to have the report assured and to seek higher quality assurance as reflected through the choices of the scope of the assurance and type of assurer, Big 4 accounting firm vs specialist consultant. Second, the authors investigate the impact of voluntary assurance of CSR reports, assurance scope and type of assurer on the likelihood of inclusion in the DJSI and on market valuation. Design/methodology/approach: The study’s sample consists of 17,050 firm-year observations from 40 countries with CSR reports available from Corporate Register and ESG metrics available from ASSET4 over the period 2009–2015. The study first empirically examines the associations between CSR commitment and each of CSR report provision, CSR report assurance, assurance scope and type of assurer. It then examines that association between both inclusion in the DJSI and market valuation with each of CSR report assurance, assurance scope and type of assurer, using inclusion in the DJSI as an objective measure of a firm’s reputation for sustainability given its recognition as a leading indicator for corporate sustainability and market valuation as a reflection of the broader set of capital market participants. Findings: The authors establish two key findings consistent with the predictions of signaling theory. First, we show that high CSR commitment firms are more likely to: provide standalone CSR reports; obtain assurance; obtain assurance from a Big 4 accounting firm; and, adopt higher assurance scope. Second, the authors find that both CSR report assurance and assurance scope increase the likelihood of inclusion in the DJSI, but that the type of assurance provider does not. Alternatively, the authors find that capital market participants appear to value the provision of a CSR report only when it is assured by a Big 4 accounting firm. Originality/value: The results in the existing literature exploring the capital market benefits to CSR Assurance have been mixed. Firms that voluntarily obtain CSR Assurance incur a cost in doing so and must perceive a net benefit from obtaining such assurance. Despite the limited guidance currently provided by existing CSR standards, we establish the existence of benefits to obtaining CSR Assurance in terms of enhanced likelihood of DJSI inclusion and, more generally, enhanced market valuation. The discussions with DJSI analysts indicate that CSR assurance does enhance the perceived reliability of CSR data, thus improving user confidence. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The increasing awareness of climate change and human capital issues is shifting companies towards aspects other than traditional financial earnings. In particular, the changing behaviors towards sustainability issues of the global community and the availability of environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators are attracting investors to socially responsible investment decisions. Furthermore, whereas the strategic importance of ESG metrics has been particularly studied for private enterprises, little attention have received public companies. To address this gap, the present work has three aims-1. To predict the accuracy of main financial indicators such as the expected Return of Equity (ROE) and Return of Assets (ROA) of public enterprises in Europe based on ESG indicators and other economic metrics; 2. To identify whether ESG initiatives affect the financial performance of public European enterprises; and 3. To discuss how ESG factors, based on the findings of aims #1 and #2, can contribute to the advancements of the current debate on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policies and practices in public enterprises in Europe. To fulfil the above aims, we use a combined approach of machine learning (ML) techniques and inferential (i.e., ordered logistic regression) model. The former predicts the accuracy of ROE and ROA on several ESG and other economic metrics and fulfils aim #1. The latter is used to test whether any causal relationships between ESG investment decisions and ROA and ROE exist and, whether these relationships exist, to assess their magnitude. The inferential analysis fulfils aim #2. Main findings suggest that ML accurately predicts ROA and ROE and indicate, through the ordered logistic regression model, the existence of a positive relationship between ESG practices and the financial indicators. In addition, the existing relationship appears more evident when companies invest in environmental innovation, employment productivity and diversity and equal opportunity policies. As a result, to fulfil aim #3 useful policy insights are advised on these issues to strengthen CSR strategies and sustainable development practices in European public enterprises. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: There are already many indices such as Bloomberg’s environmental-and-social governance (ESG) ratings and the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DSJI), which use proprietary methods to rate companies using private and publicly available information processed with proprietary methods. This paper seeks to develop a formative index for researchers and practitioners using only publicly available sustainability reports with a transparent procedure. Methods: Thirty-two indicators, obtained in an earlier study from the literature, GRI, and other sources, were adopted. The sustainability report of each of 331 companies was then scored on a discrete 0–3 scale for each indicator as regards disclosure. The index for the company then is simply a summation of the indicator scores. Tests were conducted to see if the index can be (a) used for companies with different revenues and from different sectors and (b) tested for explaining DJSI or ESG ratings. Results: The index can be used for companies with a wide range of revenues and from different sectors. Despite its simplicity, the disclosure index significantly explains the DJSI and ESG. Conclusions: A disclosure index for companies has been developed here using only their publicly available sustainability reports, unlike existing indices like the DJSI that use public and private information and proprietary methods. Researchers and financial institutions can use this index or develop their own indices by refining the methodology presented here. Copyright © 2020 by the author(s).},

This study looks at the extent of internet reporting and considers firm characteristics associated with disclosing information on the internet. This research is timely as in the past decade, this paper has witnessed the rapid growth of technologies such as the internet and social media and their subsequent impact on business and the economy. Design/methodology/approach: This paper constructs a disclosure index featuring a wide range of both financial and non-financial disclosures including social media strategy. This study then investigates the firm characteristics associated with the level of internet disclosure. Findings: This paper finds that a firm’s internet reporting is associated with firm size, financial performance and analysts’ coverage but not associated with the percentage of independent board members. A firm’s social media strategy is associated with firm size and its environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) ranking. Practical implications: The findings can help firms improve their internet reporting disclosures by providing a comprehensive list of disclosures that could benefit users of financial reports. It also helps standard setters and regulators understand some of the firm factors related to internet reporting and provide guidance for standard setters to consider in developing best practice internet reporting standards. Originality/value: The research features the top 100 Australian companies’ internet disclosures in 2018 and also includes social media strategy. The results highlight that there is room for improvement with firms’ internet disclosure.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effect of environmental, social and governance disclosure (ESGD) on firm performance (FP) before and after the introduction of integrated reporting (IR) further to exploring a potential moderation effect of corporate governance mechanisms on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Ordinary least squares and firm-fixed effects models were estimated based on data related to FTSE 350 between 2009 and 2018. The data has been mainly collected from Bloomberg and Capital IQ. This analysis was supplemented with applying a two-stage least squares (2 SLS) model to address any concerns regarding the expected occurrence of endogeneity problems. Findings: The results show a positive and significant relationship between ESGD score and FP before and after 2013, among a sample of FTSE 350. Furthermore, the study is suggestive of a moderation effect of corporate governance mechanisms (i.e. ownership concentration, gender diversity and board size) on the ESGD-FP nexus. Additionally, this paper finds that firms voluntarily associated with IR have a tendency to achieve better firm financial performance. Practical implications: The findings of the present study have several policy and practitioner implications. For example, managers may engage in ESGD to enhance their firms’ financial performance by the voluntary involvement in IR, which believed to help investors to rationalise their investment decisions. Likewise, the results reiterate the crucial need to integrate more social, environmental and economic regulations to promote sustainability in the UK. The paper also offers a systematic picture for policymakers in the UK as well as future researchers. Social implications: The findings of this paper indicate that IR plays a significant role in the relationship between ESGD and FP, where IR firms seemed to be achieving better FP as compared with their non-IR counterparts. This implies that stakeholders may have played a magnificent effort to encourage firms’ voluntary engagement in IR in the UK. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to explore the potential moderating effect of ownership concentration, gender diversity and board size on the relationship between ESGD and FP and to examine whether firms’ voluntary involvement in IR can lead to better FP after the introduction of IR in 2013 in the UK. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The multidisciplinary nature of a corporate social responsibility (CSR) committee reflects the commitment as well as the expectations and demands of diverse stakeholders. So far, CSR committees have been mainly considered as variables of control in larger corporate governance models and independent variables that determine CSR or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure and its reporting quality. However, the effect on corporate performance has been biased to financial performance, so the potential of the analysis of the effect it may have on different facets of non-financial performance has not been exploited. Which it should, since it can be a fundamental tool to achieve sustainability. The objective of this contribution is to test whether companies with a CSR committee not only leads to higher economic scores, but also to higher ESG (environmental, social, governance) scores. To do this, we used regression panel data models in 197 listed firms in Spain, France, Germany, and the UK during the period 2005-2015 including the perspective of European organizations and completing the extant studies in US-based samples. Our results showed that 90% of companies in the sample had a CSR committee in 2014, and that those companies had significantly different ESG scores than those without a CSR committee. Having a CSR committee also triggered better non-financial performance when considering the four scores and the four countries independently (except for the economic scores in Spain). These results have great implications for practitioners, reflecting the importance of promoting these tools in an organization to enhance non-financial performance and sustainability. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study examines the relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors and corporate financial performance. Specifically, we study various individual ESG categories, both ESG strengths and concerns, and aggregate ESG factor and their impact on corporate financial performance including profitability and financial risk. We find a positive effect of ESG factors on corporate profitability, and the effect is more pronounced for larger firms. Among different ESG categories, corporate governance has the most significant impact, particularly for firms with weak governance. We also find that ESG variables generally have a positive influence on credit rating. In particular, the social factor has the most significant impact on credit rating, while environmental score surprisingly has a negative effect. Overall, this research provides a rationale for ESG integration in the context of investment management and portfolio construction to maximize value and minimize risk. © 2021 by the authors.

From this perspective, many studies claim that a more balanced presence of women on Board of Directors (BoD) could have a positive impact on firms’ financial performance, but the effect of such diversity on sustainability performance is still underexplored. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how gender composition of BoD affects the corporate sustainability practices. In particular, we focused on the relationship between board gender composition and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) performance, by verifying if and to what extent there is a moderation effect due to the presence of CEO duality. We used the ESG index, provided by Bloomberg Data Service, as a proxy of sustainability performance and the Blau index as a measure of gender diversity in the BoD. The empirical analysis was carried out on a sample of Italian non-financial companies listed on Mercato Telematico Azionario (MTA) and includes a total of 128 observations. Results has shown that a greater gender diversity on BoD has an overall positive influence on ESG performance, while CEO duality negatively moderates the foregoing relationship. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Given the unsettled ESG-CFP (Environmental, Social, Governance-Corporate Financial Performance) relationship and the scarcity of research covering emerging markets firms and the impact of each of the ESG pillars on CFP while considering the industry sector categories, this paper is pioneer in investigating this relationship for 108 East Asian listed firms operating in the Industrials sector for the period extending from 2011 to 2017. The overall ESG scores together with their components are used to study their impact on CFP while considering accounting (Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE)), and market measures (Stock Return (RET) and Price-to-Book ratio (PB)). We used panel corrected standard errors to address contemporaneous cross-correlations related to the panel cross-sections. Our findings showed that the ESG-CFP relationship depends on the ESG pillars, the type of CFP measures, and the industry nature. No relationship was detected between ESG and CFP when proxied by accounting measures while a concave relationship with RET and a convex relationship with PB were revealed. When ESG pillars were considered separately, a convex relationship was obtained between Environmental and accounting performances and between Governance and PB while a concave relationship was depicted between Social and accounting performances. At the industry level, ESG negatively impacted the market performance in the Transportation industry compared to no impact in the Capital Goods industry. Consequently, ESG investment decisions in East Asian firms must be well calibrated and planned out to avoid undesired financial outcomes, while a shift in the mindset of managers toward a better ESG development is necessary to attain short-term gains and sustainable fiscal and social advantages. © 2021 Estudios de Economia Aplicada.

A multilevel quadratic growth model was used to investigate the impact of airlines’ disclosure of ESG performance indicators. The results revealed that in the initial stages of implementation of ESG-based practices, airlines demonstrate a downward trend in return on assets. However, it gradually increases after a period of incorporation and implementation. Based on this result, airlines should prioritize the selection of key performance indicators for the implementation of CSR toward sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Overall comparative performance analysis of these indices is conducted using risk-adjusted return measures and volatility has been captured through the TGARCH model. Further, time duration has been decomposed into regimes using Markov Regime Switching Model and the comparison of indices has been undertaken in both regimes. Our findings suggest that there is no significant difference between the return performance of sustainability indices and market benchmark index in single time duration and sustainability indices performing marginally better in both the regimes identified. This implies that socially responsible investments in India are providing reasonable returns to investors without comprising non-financial objectives.

The financial and market performances of companies are both analyzed in this study. Sustainable growth at the company level is introduced as a dimension that depends on sustainability reporting and the management of ESG factors. In order to achieve the main objective of the paper, the methodology here focuses on the construction of multifactorial linear regressions, in which the dependent variables are measurements of financial and market performance and assess corporate sustainable growth. The independent variables of these regressions are the sustainability metrics and the control variables included in the models. Most of the existing literature focuses on the causality between sustainability performance and financial performance. While most impact studies on financial performance are restricted to sustainability performance, this study refers to the degree of risk associated with the inadequate management of economic, social, and governance factors. This work examines the effects of ESG risk management, not only on performance, but also on corporate sustainable growth.

Design/methodology/approach: The present work uses data from the S&P/EGX ESG index, which is the first of its kind in the MENA region. The ESG index is designed to increase the profile of companies listed on the Egyptian Exchange and is expected to boost the level and quality of ESG practices in the Egyptian context. The sample includes the 100 most active Egyptian companies in the Egyptian Stock Exchange as measured by the EGX 100 index in the financial year that ended in 2016. The sample begins in 2007, concurrent with the start of the ESG index, and ends in 2016. The period from 2007 to 2010 represents the pre-revolution period, and the period from 2012 to 2016 is the post-revolution period. Findings: Firms with high ESG ratings are found to enjoy a better financial and market performance. The authors found some evidence that the influence of ESG ratings on financial performance is more obvious after the revolutions than before the revolutions. Practical implications: This study provides insights regarding the impact of political events on the market in the Middle East region. Despite its increasing economic and political importance, this region still suffers from inadequate attention in the literature. The present work investigates the variances that evolved out of the events that started in early 2011 and the implications of these events on the market. The results of this study have implications for regulators and investors in the Egyptian stock market. The authors believe that the relatively new S&P/EGX ESG index provides a way to enhance ESG ratings in Egypt. Social implications: The results of the present study provide insights for policymakers regarding the usefulness of the sustainability indices. Originality/value: The present results contribute to the growing literature on the economic consequences of ESG ratings, especially in relation to a context characterized by intense political/revolutionary changes. In particular, this study contributes to the few works that have addressed the economic implications of ESG ratings in emerging markets. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This study analyzed the relationship between the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) assessment results of the Korea Corporate Governance Service, which evaluates the sustain-ability management levels of Korean companies and the variability in the five‐year cash effective tax rates, a proxy for sustainable tax strategies. Corporate sustainability management allows the continuation of businesses that consider environmental protection, social contribution, and ethical management, as well as short‐term financial performance. We expect these companies to prioritize sustainable tax strategies that ensure the long‐term maintenance of the tax strategy results. Using a sample of firms listed in the Korean securities market during the 2011–2017 period, we adopted a two‐way clustered regression model by a firm and year and established a research model with ref-erence to previous studies and tax strategies. We found a significant negative association between excellent ESG ratings and the variability of cash effective tax rates, as well as between the imple-mentation of ESG assessments and the variability of cash effective tax rates. This result indicates that companies with excellent corporate sustainability management strengthen their sustainable tax strategies and that companies become more interested in sustainable tax strategies after implementing ESG assessments. This study sheds light on the relationship between corporate sustainability management and sustainable tax strategies, helping improve our understanding of the impact of corporate sustainability management on sustainable tax strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Past studies on the effects of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores on firm performance have found mixed support. To further unpack these findings, we focus on the effects of industry-level dynamism and the predictability of ESG scores on sales and investor expectations on the prospects of firm growth. Dynamism (predictability) is based on the standard error (R-squared) of industry ESG ratings regressed on industry sales. Taking an investor's perspective, we focus on a forward-looking performance measure, specifically, the implied volatility in a firm's 365-day at-the-money call options. Our findings show that although industry ESG-sales dynamism and predictability lower a firm's implied volatility, a higher firm-level ESG rating mitigates the decline in the implied volatility under increasing ESG-sales dynamism. The findings show that investors expect lower short-term growth potential of industry firms with experimentation in leveraging ESG to increase sales (i.e., dynamism) and only lower their discounts in growth expectations for firms with higher ESG scores. The industry-level dynamics among ESG scores and sales and investor growth expectations in the form of implied volatility are added considerations in studying ESG and performance relationships. © 2020 The Authors},

These changes are important for understanding the widespread accessibility of relevant and reliable information regarding an entity's financial and nonfinancial aspects. The purpose of this study was to show how the environmental, social, and governance disclosure performance of companies has gained a reputation of having a fundamental role in financial transparency and how it varies by stakeholder orientation and economic sector. In this regard, we developed a new model based on stakeholders' perceptions to analyze the impact of environmental, social, and governance disclosure on financial transparency using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and select the economic sector that ensures transparency in sustainable and financial reporting. This model was applied over the 2008-2018 period to 143 companies from eight countries in the most representative economic sectors: finance, energy, and telecommunication services. Our results portray that environmental, social, and governance reporting are a company's means of communication with stakeholders, as part of their accountability and stewardship obligations, and at the same time, they are a tool for achieving transparency regarding the financial performance of a firm. Furthermore, our findings also showed whether environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures act as a vector of financial communication for enterprises, and this relationship will also be evident in their role in financial transparency. © 2020 by the authors.},

However, the role of board gender diversity on environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of the banks is still unaccounted for. Drawing on resource dependence and legitimacy theory, this study addresses this pressing research issue. Moreover, investigation of ESG controversies as a moderator paves the existing corporate governance research to the new avenues. Design/methodology/approach: Data were sourced from Refinitiv database on 37 US banks from the period of 2013 to 2017. This study employs static and dynamic panel regression models that include random effects, fixed effects and dynamic generalised method of moments (GMMs) to test the hypotheses. Furthermore, system GMM is used to reduce the issue of endogeneity, measurement error, omitted variables bias and bank-specific heterogeneity. Findings: We identify a significant positive relationship between board gender diversity and the ESG performance of US banks. However, the result propounds non-significant moderating effect of ESG controversies on the board gender diversity–ESG performance nexus. Originality/value: Literature on board gender diversity and ESG separately and predominantly explains firm/bank's financial performance. This study is one of the pioneering attempts to explain the role of board gender diversity on ESG performance. Although incremental, however, this study also contributes to the literature on ESG in the US context. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In addition to supporting the beneficial effect of gender diversity on performance, the study reveals the mediating mechanism through the ESG orientation of companies explaining almost 4% of the total effect of gender diversity on performance. By analyzing two levels of diversity, the study revealed the superiority of the effect of gender diversity in BDs as compared to ECs.

First, the board diversity metrics of the public companies in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are derived and compared to a sample of listed companies in other European countries to provide a relative comparison of the current degree of board diversity. Next, by performing content analysis of the non-financial reports and statistical analysis of the retrieved data, ESG disclosure scores are obtained. Finally, a correlation and independent t-test analysis is performed to evaluate the board diversity's influence on the ESG disclosure scores. The results show that companies with larger boards and companies having female representatives on their supervisory boards have on average higher non-financial disclosures scores. No statistically significant results are found for gender diversity on the management boards. The results shed a light on the current stance of the board diversity of the listed Baltic companies as well as contribute to the growing academic literature trying to derive the sustainability drivers in the corporate set-up. © 2020 Mykolo Romerio Universitetas.

Furthermore, the controversies score allows us to examine the mid-to-long-term effects of scandals on the CFP without having to rely on the event study methodology. Even though a value-weighted strategy does not show any significant abnormal returns, we examined a significant outperformance for equally weighted worst ESG portfolios and best controversies strategies. These results strongly indicate that this is, on the one hand, driven by low-rated smaller companies (“small sinners”) and clean-coated firms with regard to controversies (“silent saints”) on the other hand. The findings hold for several robustness checks such as adjusting the cutoff rates or splitting the dataset across time. © 2020, The Author(s).},

The content analysis was used to analyse the ESG performance of the sample companies from their annual and sustainability reports. For this purpose, ESG disclosure index is constructed with the help of GRI framework, Clause 49 of listing agreement and relevant literature. Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method was used to examine the relationship between the ESG disclosure index and the independent variables, namely the financial performance, market performance, FIIs stake and leverage after statistically controlling the effects of a firm’s size and the industry type of the companies; results based on the formulated model indicated that financial and market performance have a positive and significant association with the level of ESG disclosure, whereas FIIs stake and leverage have a negative and significant association with the level of ESG disclosure. The findings are limited to the context of the study, and it was limited to Indian companies listed at Bombay Stock Exchange for the period 2013–2016. The sources of data in this study were companies’ annual and sustainability reports. The study may be constructive for organizations and statutory bodies to take into consideration in identification of corporate attributes that will enhance ESG disclosure, since it had been shown in literature that the voluntary corporate social responsibility and corporate governance reporting in India is generally low. In recent times, there has been an increase in ESG reporting, to address the increasing concerns of the stakeholders. Thus, this study will emphasize the level of activities through ESG reporting in Indian companies and help the government to ascertain the level of ESG activities through corporate social responsibility reporting among Indian companies.

The challenge remains how to empirically quantify climate risk from an investment perspective and build investable portfolios that address the transition to a low-carbon economy. This study analyzes the available metrics for capturing climate-related investment considerations. We undertake a comprehensive review of the data characteristics for metrics such as carbon intensity, green revenue, and fossil fuel reserves, highlighting their coverage and distributional characteristics. These data characteristics are critical when integrating them into investment strategies. Building on our findings, we propose a framework for building climate strategies within public equities which rests on both mitigating the impact of climate risk today and adapting to climate risk in the future. This ‘mitigation and adaptation’ framework has enough flexibility to build portfolios at different levels of concentration, tracking error, and climate risk exposure. For example, we can build a portfolio which aligns with climate model projections. We illustrate our framework with a portfolio calibrated to align with the most conservative climate model projections, which seek to limit cumulative CO2 emissions to a threshold below the 2°C scenario. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The Belgium Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) market was created primarily to facilitate a transparent, professionally managed and fiscally efficient market, providing access to the European property markets. Being the 2nd oldest REIT market in Europe, it has undergone many evolutionary changes over the years that add to its considerable stature as a sophisticated investment opportunity. This includes an increased recent focus on the social infrastructure property sectors such as healthcare, care facilities and nursing homes, consistent with the evolving investment mandates requiring stronger integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects in the investment strategy formulation. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the strategic transformation of Belgium REITs and empirically assess their performance attributes over 1995–2018. Sub-period performance dynamics of Belgium REITs in the pre-global financial crises (GFC) (1995–2007) and post-GFC (2009–2018) contexts are provided. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 23-year monthly total returns over 1995–2018 were used to analyse the risk-adjusted performance and portfolio diversification potential of Belgium REITs. The traditional mean-variance portfolio optimisation model using the ex-post returns, risk and correlation coefficient of Belgium REITs and other financial assets was developed to determine the added-value benefits of Belgium REITs in a diversified investment framework. The analysis was further extended to cover the sub-periods of pre-GFC (1995–2007) and post-GFC (2009–2018). Findings: The results of the analysis provide a strong investment case for Belgium REITs, as they are able to deliver a discernible premium in the total return performance, superior risk-adjusted returns and strong diversification benefits with the stock market in a long-term investment horizon. Broadly consistent results are similarly observed in the sub-period analysis over varying market conditions. Importantly, the role of Belgium REITs in a diversified investment framework was also empirically validated, as they enhanced the mixed-asset portfolio performance comprised of the traditional asset classes of stocks and bonds across a broad portfolio risk-return spectrum. Dividend yield was also found to be a key component of the financial performance of Belgium REITs. Practical implications: The Belgium REIT market has evolved to become the 5th largest market in Europe by the capitalisation volume. This is mainly due to the robust regulatory support and innovations since its debut which have resulted in a polished framework that is both supportive and attractive to financial players and investors. The broad direct consequence of this paper is to highlight the performance attributes of Belgium REITs, adding clarity to the ongoing discussion regarding the viability of European REITs as a liquid and tax transparent route for institutional investors to obtain their property exposure. The strong dividend yield and ESG/social infrastructure focus of Belgium REITs sees Belgium REITs well-placed going forward to meet the evolving investment mandates from major investors. Originality/value: This paper is the first empirical investigation that elucidates the risk-adjusted performance and role of Belgium REITs as an important property investment opportunity. It equips investors and practitioners with an independent and comprehensive empirical validation of the strategic role of Belgium REITs in a portfolio. Well-informed and practical property investment decision making regarding the use of Belgium REITs for access to the property asset class is the main outcome of this paper. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

For Banking Services, the research was extended to a link between corporate social performance and corporate financial performance (CSP-CFP) by classifying institutions into clusters based on a type of culture which dominates in a bank’s country of origin. Regression analysis was run on a unique dataset, which comprehensively captures the contextuality of CSP, measured with corporate governance, environmental and social characteristics. This research uses Refinitiv database of ESG Scores as CSP proxy for banks from all over the world in the period of 2009–2016. The results confirm that environmental performance and social performance have negative impact on CFP in banks and partly confirmed that governance performance has a positive impact on their CFP. This research proves that banks’ CSP performance and the CSP-CFP relationship differs with regard to the type of bank operations as well as the associated culture. This is an important conclusion for investors seeking to increase value of their holdings and bank management who wants to foster bank’s profitability through CSP-related decisions. © 2020 The Author(s).},

Specifically, firms who disclose more social responsibility information faced reduced costs to debt financing. We argue that disclosure of Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) records provide value relevant information for lenders to use to mitigate the magnified information asymmetry inherent to lending to firms earlier in their lifecycle.

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of the paper is to examine the association of corporate governance (CG), the firms’ characteristics and the financial performance of firms operating in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region after Arab Spring. The study focuses on CG, exemplified by boards’ composition and ownership structure. It also explores the possible moderating effects of environmental social and governance characteristics (ESG), leverage and size on the relationship between CG and the company’s performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using Thomson-Reuters database, a sample of 67 firms was extracted in the MENA region to measure CG and financial performance post Arab Spring from 2012 to 2016. Panel GLS regression random effects is used to quantify the relationship; robustness is checked by using several alternative regressions and specifications to the performance measure. Findings: The results reveal that board independence (BI) is negatively correlated with firm profitability but ownership concentration and board gender diversification contribute to profits. When firms that voluntarily form a governance committee are examined, ownership is less concentrated. We obtain a stronger impact of good governance on performance in these firms: board composition, in general, and workers’ satisfaction generate more profits; and undertaking ESG activities become a more dispensable activity. The effect of board size (BS) and forming a governance committee are studied and ensuing recommendations are drawn. In addition, relevant internal control of firms’ characteristics that strongly predict firms’ market values are discussed in the context of agency and stewardship theories. Originality/value: Despite the fact that governance-performance nexus has been extensively discussed and examined, the focus of this volume of research is on western developed countries. The growing economies of the MENA countries, and the limited governance-performance literature in the MENA context have created a demand to understand the governance environment in these countries and its influence on firm’s performance. In this region where firms’ owners are mainly family members, governments and/or institutions, governance is typically weak; moreover, ownership concentration is expected to guarantee good performance, as the role of independent directors becomes ineffective. For firms where ownership is more diluted, a sound governance system should be established to replace ownership concentration, and to more efficiently monitor management, and consequently improve firm performance. Therefore, this study not only contributes a summary of the prevailing corporate structure in MENA. Moreover, it explains the settings where both the stewardship and agency theories apply in MENA firms. Some recommendation on the importance of changes to the existing governance rules are highlighted in terms of more rules requiring board independence, board gender diversity, limits on board size and establishing governance committees. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Analysis of compensation policies is biased to financial performance, so that the effectiveness of sustainable policies remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether having a sustainable compensation policy has a positive influence on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and economic scores. These relationships are tested by estimating a fixed-effects model for listed companies from Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom in the period 2005–2015. According to the results, sustainable compensation policies affect ESG scores, but especially when firms have a corporate social responsibility committee acting as control mechanism and supporting the achievement of those objectives, triggering better nonfinancial performance.

	abstract = {Purpose: Global gender diversity and equality indexes have been developed to promote gender diversity and equality at the country level, but it is difficult to see how those indexes are applied to organizations on a daily basis. The purpose of this study is to examine the application of environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures for gender diversity and equality at the organizational level in a Korean context. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the institutional theory, the authors reviewed ESG measures for gender diversity and equality of women funds in four countries (USA, Canada, UK and Japan) and examined The Women Fund in Korea through document analysis and interviews. Findings: ESG measures in four countries’ women funds mainly assessed the percentage of women in the workforce, on boards and in leadership positions. In The Women Fund, gender diversity indicators consider the ratio of female to male employees, while gender equality indicators take into account gaps of male and female salaries and positions. This study’s impact analysis indicates that the companies invested in by The Women Fund had higher return on assets and return on equity than those without the fund. Research limitations/implications: Although women funds explored in this study exemplify the use of ESG measures to apply global gender diversity and equality indexes at the organizational level, research is needed to examine ESG measures and women funds and their associations. Possible topics include what needs to be measured in ESG, who should be involved, how ESG measures should be applied, what outcomes of using ESG measures would ensue in organizations and how ESG measures relate to regional and global gender diversity. Practical implications: In promoting ESG measures that apply global gender diversity and equality at the organizational level, human resource development practitioners, as change agents, can help organizations develop socially responsible and ethical behaviors and transform organizational culture, practice and systems, which may influence organizations’ long-term survival and development as well as financial performance. Social implications: As the government’s support and policies guide and drive firms to develop and implement initiatives and programs, the launch and implementation of gender diversity and equality at the organizational level in the form of women funds require a certain level of collaboration between the government and the private sector. Originality/value: This study on the application of ESG measures for global gender diversity and equality at the organizational level in the form of women funds is timely to engage organizations in dialogue regarding what needs to be done to promote women’s participation and leadership roles in organizations in Korea and other countries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Background: Ten years have elapsed since the launch of the International Integrated Reporting Council. Stakeholders increasingly question whether integrated reporting (IR) meets the objectives of decision-usefulness and accountability. Aim: The primary objective of this study was to assess the usefulness of IR by examining the interrelations between the integrated reporting quality (IRQ), sustainability performance and financial performance of listed companies in South Africa. Setting: The study is conducted in the country where integrated reporting is most established. The links between the IRQ of the Top 100 companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and their environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) scores and multiple financial indicators are investigated over the period 2013–2018. Methods: The EY Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards was used as a metric to determine the sample companies’ IRQ. These awards were ranked according to four categories, namely ‘progress to be made’, ‘average’, ‘good’ and ‘excellent’. Sustainability (ESG scores), as well as financial performance data (accounting-based and market-based variables) were sourced from Bloomberg. The panel data set was analysed by conducting a mixed-model analysis of variance and panel regressions. Results: A high level of IRQ was found to be significantly associated with high levels of ESG performance, as well as high earnings per share and high leverage. Conclusion: It appears that IR strengthens managerial efficiency and legitimacy in the eyes of debt capital providers in South Africa, while equity capital providers do not provide a clear signal of approval. © 2020.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of CSR on stock price volatility of the US banks. This study further examined the moderating role of tax on the relationship between CSR and stock price volatility. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the random-effects panel regression estimation technique to test the hypotheses. The authors include a sample of 37 US banks from 2013 to 2017 with 144 bank-years observation. The authors consider the environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores from Refinitiv as a proxy for CSR. The financial data are also collected from the Refinitiv Datastream database. Findings: This study finds a significant and positive relationship between CSR and stock price volatility, which indicates that shareholders of the US banks may not prefer excess concentration on CSR because of the additional cost of investment associated with implementing CSR. Also, tax payments and stock price volatility show a significant positive association, which implies that there is a higher possibility of an increase in stock price volatility if the tax rate increases. Generally, shareholders are not interested in paying more taxes, so they may swap the market instead of paying more tax. On the other hand, the authors find a non-significant moderating effect of tax payment on CSR-volatility nexus. Originality/value: Previous studies mainly focussed on CSR and financial performance of banks. Conversely, studies focussing on CSR and stock volatility are limited. This study will fill the gap in the literature by considering the effect of CSR on the stock price volatility of the US banks. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In order to know the suitability of sustainability indices as benchmarks for SR investors, we used different linear regressions to compare the compositions of sustainability indices and their conventional counterparts and to compare the levels of corporate social responsibility (CSR) of both types of indices. We showed that the composition of sustainability indices gradually converged towards their conventional peers. Moreover, the difference between the CSR levels of both type of indices remained the same or even decreased over time. We concluded that a change in the weighting method of sustainability indices such as the equally weighted criterion would significantly increase the difference from their conventional counterparts. However, due to the relationship between CSR and size, this change would penalize the CSR level of the index. These results raise the question of whether SR passive investors will be able to meet their non-financial expectations as a consequence of the convergence. © 2021 by the authors.

It recognizes the threat of current global consumption levels to exceed the planetary boundaries and asks what roles financial markets may play in reducing these threats without compromising PWB. SI integrates environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) factors alongside financial factors in investments in company shares and bonds as well as through active engagement in companies. Barriers to ESG integration include lower short-term financial performance, higher financial risks, and insufficient ESG screening by investors. A brief review of PWB shows that reliable and valid measurement methods have been developed, that the resulting measures complement economic and social national welfare indicators, and that health, sufficient material welfare, income equality, and non-material consumption are important determinants of PWB. The challenge is to globally reduce private material consumption levels in affluent countries. It is suggested that one role SI may play is in investing or actively engaging in companies that efficiently meet an increasing consumer demand of non-material consumption. Future research should address this role of SI. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This study aims to explore the bidirectional relationship between corporate sustainable and financial performance based on the short-run causality. The purpose is to identify possible approaches the companies may address in the endeavour of reframing their business model. The research examines the companies in energy industry worldwide, included in Thomson Reuters Eikon database, standing for possible causal associations between sustainable and financial performance variables, further controlled by variables reflecting specific characteristics of companies. Corporate sustainable performance, measured by environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors is related with the shareholders-oriented performance, measured by accounting and market financial ratios. The research hypothesis is verified by performing bidirectional Granger causality tests on data previously validated by stationarity tests, complemented then by unidirectional associations based on multiple regression analysis. The results support a feedback bidirectional relationship in the case of return on equity, and a financial growth hypothesis for the market to book value when associated with the aggregated corporate sustainable performance. Furthermore, the Granger causality findings are validated by the OLS regression tests. The unidirectional causality verifies for the sustainable growth hypothesis supporting the significant impact of the sustainable performance measures (both aggregated and controversies-related) on the majority of the financial performance measures. Findings show that the change in the aggregated sustainable performance may lead to a change in the market measure of financial performance that may generate incentives for the company to reinvest in sustainability-related actions. The study provides a value-added to current knowledge by including into the research a multidimensional score reflecting the sustainabilityoriented policies of the companies around the world, activating in a sensitive sustainability-oriented industry. This paper proposes future research for better understanding the specific characteristics of energy industry in terms of sustainabilityrelated policies, by including into research the controversies generated by the scandals the companies were involved in, as a corporate legitimacy-related measure. © ECIAIR 2020.All right reserved.},

	abstract = {In this study, we examine the extent to which the implementation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures influence the firm value and financial performance of airlines. The panel data analysis is applied to the set of collected data from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database for the sample of 27 airlines worldwide from 2013 to 2019. Findings of this study support the positive relationship between the environmental pillar score (Env) and governance pillar score (Gov), with market-to-book ratio and Tobin’s Q as proxies for firm value and financial performance, respectively. This finding implies that an increase in both pillars leads to higher market value and financial efficiency for investigated airlines. Therefore, an airline’s effort to improve Env and Gov dimensions will lead to higher market value and return on invested funds. In contrast, the social pillar disclosure in both models is found to have a significant negative association with the dependent variables, showing that airlines’ social activities result in lower value as well as level of performance. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Does doing “good” always translate into doing “well”? Debate over the “value” of corporate social responsibility is high on the agenda of corporate finance research. Deeper understanding is required on managers' incentives to pursue and implement corporate social responsibility related strategies, as is more thorough comprehension of the effect of these strategies to firms' performance levels as well as shareholder and wider stakeholder valuations of the firm. This paper provides a new lens by approaching the subject from a different methodological paradigm, grounded in the performance benchmarking methods more commonly applied in operational research. In so doing, we provide novel evidence of the effect of corporate choices on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategic investment compliance (i.e., doing good) to firms' eco-efficiency levels (doing well). In brief, our empirical findings suggest that ESG and firm's eco-performance are nonlinearly related. Specifically, advanced ESG policies and disclosure levels are associated with a positive affect to firms' eco-efficiency levels, but only up to a point, after which the effect becomes “neutral,” that is, ESG demonstrates a visible pattern of diminishing marginal returns. Thus, we may humbly conclude that a firm may “do well” by doing good, but it is not clear they should ever expect to “do great” just by “doing good.” The threshold at which this “neutrality” appears varies systematically with the characteristics of the sector in which the firm is operating, as well as dimensions of board diversity. Finally, it is evident that ESG implementation choices can be a source of managerial agency problems. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

	abstract = {Awareness on issues relating to business ethics in corporate social responsibility (CSR), good corporate governance (GCG), and environmental social governance (ESG) has significantly increased in the last decade in the academic and professional fields. As a consequence, a large number of theoretical and empirical studies, research and professional publications, and guidelines have been published. This trend toward academic scrutiny is a significant change to the traditional way of understanding corporate governance and has led to an increasing number and diversity of stakeholders to which the corporations must be held accountable. Traditionally, corporate governance has focused on “financial” aspects with the aim of improving the protection rights of corporate stakeholders whereas the CSR approach has been limited to the consideration of only economic, social, and environmental issues. However, there has, in the recent past, been a convergence of the four concepts that are increasingly frequently being jointly studied by academics and practitioners. A clear example of this convergence is the use of the ESG criteria in the assessment of sustainable investment portfolios. In this context, the aim of this paper is to present the current state of research on convergence themes (focusing on CSR and CG) in order to present the resulting framework as a basis for the subsequent analysis of the relationship between good governance practices, the CSR, and financial performance. Finally, the effectiveness of such practices and strategies will be assessed. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between corporate debt-like compensation and the value of excess cash holdings. Design/methodology/approach: The environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure score provided by Bloomberg is used as a proxy for the extent of corporate social responsibility (CSR). The empirical analysis is based on a sample of 379 firms that made up the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index over the period 2010-2015. In order to take into account the endogeneity problem between board gender diversity and ESG disclosure, a fixed effect model with lagged board variables is used. Findings: Two main results arise from this study. First, no significant relationship is found between board gender diversity and ESG disclosure. Second, the evidence also partially confirms critical mass theory, as below three female directors the relationship between board gender diversity and ESG disclosure is not statistically significant. However, beyond that, no significant relationship was found. Research limitations/implications: Reasonable theoretical arguments drawn from stakeholder theory suggest that board gender diversity may have a positive effect on ESG disclosure. The empirical evidence presented neither supports, nor denies stakeholder theory. However, the results may be improved by enlarging the frontiers of this research in time and space, increasing the perimeter of qualitative data integrated in this investigation. Practical implications: This paper offers theoretical and empirical arguments for the feminization of corporate boards, not only in the name of equality between women and men and organizational justice, but also in the light of organizational performance (examined through the prism of governance). Transparency, analyzed using the proxy of ESG disclosure, is strongly and positively correlated with a feminization of boards, if the proportion of women is significant and sufficient to be able to prevent and surpass the “invisibilization” phenomenon, which is based on the marginalization of passive ultra-minorities, reduction to silence, marginalization (disqualification of women voice or exit strategy), assimilation or the endorsement of stigma. Originality/value: First, this makes a theoretical contribution to the diversity and governance literature by examining the effect of WOCB on ESG disclosure through the stakeholder theory (Freeman, 2010). Second, the authors contribute to the CSR literature (cf. Byron and Post, 2016) by documenting specifically the effect of board gender diversity on CSR disclosures through ESG. Indeed, ESG research mainly concentrates on firm financial performance (Galbreath, 2013). No study has examined the relationship between WOCB and ESG disclosure. Finally, from an empirical standpoint, an FE model with lagged board variables (Liu et al., 2014) is used to fully address the endogeneity problems in the relationship between WOCB and ESG disclosure that may occur because of differences in unobservable characteristics across firms or reverse causality (Boulouta, 2013). © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Starting from this premise, we carried out an original study on the financial materiality of the E-S-G (environmental, social and governance) information of primary companies listed on major European indices in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain (BEL, CAC, DAX, FTSE-MIB, IBEX). Within the Stakeholder Theory and the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)-Corporate Social Perfomance (CSP) framework, our empirical analysis examined the impact of non-financial results (assessed through sustainability indicators) on economic (financial and market) performance in the timespan 2014-2017. We propose a different approach from previous studies, based on a PLS (Partial least squares)/SEM (Structural equation modeling) methodology together with the unprecedented consideration of "ESG" measures (Environmental, Social and Governance), either absolute (scores) or relative (extra-performance over industry sector). We find that, despite the absolute level of the individual ESG scores not being impactful, the "distance" from the industry average-normal figures (excess or abnormal ESG performance) is positively relevant, collaterally revisiting the notion of competitive advantage in sustainability terms. Corporate size is shown to be a significant background factor (as slack resources proxy). Social, environmental and governance responsibility (to all stakeholders) appear to be important as a competitive factor of the modern firm. © 2019 by the authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: The author uses a large sample of firms over a 21-year period from 1992 to 2013 taken from firms cross-listed in the ESG STATS, Execucomp, and Compustat databases. Logistic regression is used to analyze the determinants of both CEO turnover and the gender of the newly hired CEO. Findings: Firms with better social performance have higher rates of CEO turnover, performance notwithstanding. Further, for firms with decreasing financial performance, it is more likely they will replace their CEO if they have strong CSR vs firms with weak CSR records. In addition, as performance deteriorates, male CEOs will have a higher chance of being replaced relative to female CEOs. For female CEOs, other factors besides financial performance are important determinants of the likelihood of a turnover taking place. Research limitations/implications: This study finds support for the stakeholder theory of CSR and does not support entrenchment theory. It is the first study to look at CSR, CEO turnover, and gender issues concurrently. Practical implications: For practitioners looking for tangible effects of CSR in the workplace, this paper provides evidence that it does matter in terms of CEO turnover. The findings suggest that CSR is acting as a deterrent to bad behavior on the part of executives in the face of weak financial performance in particular. Originality/value: This study is the first to look at the impact of CSR on CEO turnover. Importantly, the findings suggest that CSR is not something that a firm decides or thinks about in the “right” financial environment but is rather an omnipresent focus embedded within the mission of the firm. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to provide an index benchmarking financial services firms against their environmental performance. The paper also introduces a new definition of the environmental risk that fits the current business and regulatory landscape of financial services firms. The Environmental Risk Index (ERI) helps financial services firms review their corporate social responsibility (CSR)/environmental and social governance (ESG) frameworks and address any shortcomings. With this in mind, every financial institution should understand that the Index is not primarily about the ranking, but about the highlighted areas that require significant investment to improve the overall management and understanding of environmental risk. This paper points to the link between being “green” and financial performance. As it transpires, addressing environmental risk serves not only the planet but also banks themselves by bringing in new business, reducing costs and avoiding reputational damage. Design/methodology/approach – The ERI relies on 44 variables grouped into ten thematic vectors that relate to different aspects of environmental risk management. Data for calculating the ERI are obtained by reviewing CSR and Sustainability Reports produced annually by financial services firms. Reports encompassing 2013 have been analysed to ensure objectivity and comparability of the results. A universal approach to all organisations has been taken in the numerical calculation of this index. The variables have been constructed such that they fit a wide range of institutions, from G-SIB banks and international asset managers through to smaller, domestic firms. As it transpires, the efforts to become “greener” are similar for financial institutions regardless of their market capitalisation or international reach. Findings – As far as the general ranking for the ERI is concerned, the range between the first and the last bank equals 524 points. With the maximum of 1,000 points that could be achieved in the ranking, the average score is 633 points and over 50 per cent of the banks have scored above the average. As it transpires, European banks outperform institutions from other regions with the average ERI score of 700. Banks repressing the Middle East region lag behind in their environmental performance. Interestingly, ERI scores and revenue figures are almost uncorrelated for large banks. This proves that any bank, despite its global presence and revenue, can develop similar environmental risk initiatives. The empirical analysis of the index results and revenue figures suggest that the revenue is related to the environmental performance. In other words, it is profitable to become “greener”. For every point in the ERI score gained, the revenue should increase slightly by a factor of 0.02. Practical/implications – This paper cuts through the environmental jargon, extensive literature review on environmental issues, socio-political issues and scientific study to deliver a clear picture of what needs to be done in the area of the environmental risk for financial services firms to reduce costs, increase business, improve reputation, address certain regulatory initiatives, strengthen the environmental and social governance and become more environmentally responsible. Originality/value – This paper, in a pioneering attempt, has presented the ERI encompassing financial services firms. At this point, the paper serves as a benchmarking tool for financial institutions willing to compare their “green” status. Looking at environmental risk has become an important part of the journey towards carefully managing business processes to generate a positive image. The importance of environmental risk is further underscored by investors, shareholders and regulators taking an increasing interest in banks’ activities. With this in mind, financial services firms need to scrutinise their operations with a particular focus on the quality of management in terms of people, environment and processes. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices disclosure and firm value in the Egyptian context. This is done through investigating the influence of being listed and ranked in the Egyptian Corporate Responsibility Index on firm value during the period starting from 2007 to 2016. Design/methodology/approach: Using univariate and multivariate analyses, the findings support the economic benefits of ESG disclosures. Findings: The authors find that firms listed in the ESG index have higher firm value, and that there is a positive association between firms’ higher rankings in the index and firm value, as measured by Tobin’s q. Research limitations/implications: The findings provide feedback to regulators and standard-setters in the developing countries, and more specifically the Egyptian regulators, on the benefits associated with the introduction of the sustainability index (Standard & Poor’s (S&P)/EGX ESG index). This, in turn, clarifies how the government’s efforts to promote ESG provide benefits to publicly traded firms. Practical implications: By linking ESG to firm value, the ESG index will enable investors to take a leading role in inducing firms to enhance transparency and disclosure, and hence, improving their reporting standards. This, in turn, will ultimately result in improving sustainability and governance practices in Egypt. Social implications: The reported positive market reactions to social and governance practices disclosures can motivate firms to improve their social and governance performance. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by addressing the combined economic effects of social and governance disclosures on firm value, and by investigating the economic effects of such disclosures on firm value in an emerging market. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Additionally, the results reveal that ESG performance has a significant impact on financial performance for companies that adopted the principles of the UNGC. These findings provide both non-financial and financial incentives to companies to commit to this voluntary corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative, which will have important implications on companies' strategic management policies that aim to foster sustainable businesses and community development.

This is due to the growing realization that ESG factors constitute a significant source of risk for the business and can affect their financial returns. Academic research has shown that improved ESG performance has lowered risk and enhanced financial performance but results seemed to vary widely across countries. Regrettably, this subject remains largely un-researched in the context of emerging economies, including India. This paper attempts to fill this much needed gap in sustainability literature in one of the largest emerging market economies, India. It empirically examines the impact of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) performance of companies on their financial performance, in India, using panel regression models.

In doing so, this study considers CSR as a latent variable measured by environmental and social category scores of Thomson Reuters ESG. To overcome limitations of a single-equation regression analysis, structural equation modelling (SEM) is employed to investigate the relationship between CSR and firm value. Based on data of US companies from 2002 to 2016, this study demonstrates that traditional regression analysis produces inconsistent relationships between CSR and firm value. By contrast, SEM provides strong evidence in support of the positive CSR effect on firm value. Interestingly, a main channel for CSR in driving firm value is social engagement rather than environmental involvement. These results have important implications for corporate managers in enhancing firm value through CSR strategies and socially responsible investors in making equity investment choices.

We use Bloomberg's Environmental Social Governance (ESG) Disclosure score covering the S&P500 firms in the period 2007-2011 which allows for the examination of both linear and nonlinear relationships to be considered. The results of the linear model suggest that there is a significant negative relationship between CSP and Return on Capital. However, the non linear models provide evidence of a U-shaped relationship between CSP and the accounting-based measures of CFP, suggesting that in the longer run CSP effects are positive. Most prominent among our results is that fact that by disentangling the ESG Disclosure score into its environmental, social and governance sub-components, we find that a U-shaped relationship exists only between the governance sub-component and CFP. A straightforward implication of our findings suggests that in order for CSR to serve the interests of the shareholders, a long-run planning and considerable resources should be dedicated at this direction, given that CSR expenditure pays off only after a threshold of CSP has been reached. Furthermore, the fact that governance is the key driver affecting the CSP-CFP relationship suggests that CSR investments should be directed to this component. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Data from the Bloomberg environmental, social and governance (ESG) and COMPUSTAT financial database are used for an empirical analysis of the relationships. Findings: Integrated sustainable supply chain management, jointly including social and environmental supply chain management, efforts is positively associated with corporate financial performance measured by return on assets and return on equity, and the positive effects can have a time lag of at least two years. Research limitations/implications: By adopting the ESG database, the paper only tests corporate sustainability supply chain management using a binary 0-1 valuation. Three-year data period is also a limitation for an extensive time study. A research implication is that win-win benefits may accrue, but additional nuances may exist such as indirect influences that need to be studied. Practical implications: Two major implications of this study are that organizations may wish to implement both environmental and social supply chain management simultaneously to get the greatest benefit, and that managers need to be patient about reaping the rewards of these initiatives. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the sustainability management literature by being the first to use publicly available data to investigate the financial benefits associated with individual and joint environmental and social supply chain management activities.

The authors employed a US sample covering the period 1998-2007. Design/methodology/approach – In the context of the Fama and French model augmented by momentum and industry factors, the authors test the significance of the alpha for a CSP difference portfolio, defined as high-ranked minus low-ranked CSP stocks. Findings – The results are consistent with the “no-linkage” hypothesis, which argues that no significant difference in the risk-adjusted performance is expected between high- and low-ranked CSP-formed portfolios. Furthermore, little evidence was found that high- or low-ranked CSP-formed portfolios, irrespective of the portfolio formation type, systematically differ with regard to performance, size, book-to-market or momentum factors. Originality/value – The authors employ sustainability CSP rankings that focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) materiality factors, in contrast to many prior studies that solely use KLD ratings or just focus on a subarea of CSP. Moreover, the authors' dataset considerably improves upon previous studies employing similar data in which individual company rankings are not available. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper fits in a research field dealing with the impact of Corporate Ethics Assessment on Financial Performance. The authors argue how environmental, social and governance (ESG) paradigm, meant to measure corporate social performance by rating issuance, can impact on abnormal returns of Italian firms listed on Financial Times Stock Exchange Milano Indice di Borsa (FTSE MIB) Index, developing a panel data analysis which runs from 2007 to 2015. Design/methodology/approach: This study aims at exploring whether socially responsible investors outperform an excess market return on Italian Stock Exchange because of their investment behavior, testing statistically the relationship between the yearly ESG assessment issued by Standard Ethics Agency on FTSE MIB’s companies and their abnormal returns. To verify the impact of an ESG Rating on a company’s abnormal return, the authors developed a panel data analysis through a Fixed Effects Model. They measured abnormal returns via Fama–French approach, running a yearly Jensen’s Performance Index for each company under investigation. Findings: The empirical results denote in Italy both a growing interest to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability by managers over the past decade, as well as an improving quality in ESG assessments because of a reliable corporate disclosure. Thus, despite investors have been applying ESG criteria in their stock – picking operations, the authors found a not positive and statistically significant impact in terms of market premium, when they have been undertaking a socially responsible investment (SRI). Practical implications: The findings described above show that ethics is not yet a reliable fundraising tool for Italian-listed companies, despite SRIs having a positive growth rate over past decade. Investors seem to be not pricing CSR on Stock Exchange Market; therefore, listed companies cannot be rewarded with a premium price because of their highly stakeholder oriented behavior. Originality/value: This paper explores, for the first time in Italy, when market extra-returns (if any) are related to corporate social performance and how managers leverage ethics to build capital added value. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, the strategic implications of corporate social responsibility (CSR) have become one of the most important themes of research in the literature of business in society. While the understanding of a company has been placed for years within the presumed conflict between shareholder and stakeholder, today the shift towards an integrated approach is expected by various constituencies and driven by regulation. Thus, corporate governance (CG) focusing solely on financial performance cannot be an asset for companies if detached from the assumptions of socially and environmentally responsible business. CSR isolated from strategy and governance does not provide the fundamental change towards integrated thinking and a transition to a low-emission, resource-efficient economy. This article is based on a systematic literature review addressing links between corporate governance and CSR at the company level. We indicate a radical reorientation in both concepts and reveal the corresponding evolution of the theoretical view developing from agency theory towards enlightened shareholder value and a stakeholder-agency view. Specifically, adopting two dimensions of strategic fit between CSR activity and the core business and formal environmental, social, and governance (ESG) compliance, we propose a four-mode integration construct of a corporate social responsibility and corporate governance (CSR-CG) relationship. We identify actions undertaken by a company in the selected modes with respect to strategic focus, supervision, accountability, performance measures, and reporting. © 2019, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

The results indicate that though the daily compounded returns to the ESG India Index are not statistically different from those of the Nifty or those of the CNX 500, annualised returns of the ESG India Index have been better than the returns of the other two indexes. Thus, focussing on environmental and social sustainability is a win–win situation for companies, investors and the society at large. There is significant volatility clustering in all the three indexes. The ESG India Index has been less volatile compared with the Nifty during the period. These results have corporate implications to focus on ESG parameters seriously in order to benefit from its sensitivity in the stock markets.

At the same time there are barriers to the full ESG integration in the investment process primarily connected with the lack of standardized data, information comparability, reliability, completeness and timeliness; limited knowledge and guidance for ESG risk and opportunity measures and appropriate analytical tools as well as lack of dialogue between the investment community and the reporting companies.

Findings show that corporate governance indicators are most reported by Malaysian construction companies compared to other environmental or social indicators. It was also found that details on actual health and safety performance of these companies and the initiatives implemented were largely absent from their reporting. Given the increasing number of rating tools in the capital markets which serve to rank and file companies based on their sustainability disclosures and performance such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and FTSE4Good Index, it is questionable as to how reliable this can be done for the Malaysian property and construction market.

Methodology/approach -Using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression technique on 391 company-year observations between 2005 and 2010 to examine the nature of the relationship that exists between firm performance (PER) and ownership variables, and test whether this relationship is significant. Findings -Our evidence provides support for the view that top five institutional shareholders take a longer-term view and are more involved with governance suggesting that the size of shareholdings has an effect when it comes to monitoring managerial decisions. Research limitations/implications -Due to the small sample size, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results of this study. Also, it is to be noted that this study is based on a small country with an open capital market where there is high proportion of institutional ownership. Practical implications -The results provide useful insights into the role different types of institutional investors play in terms of enhancing both governance and firm performance. Our analyses suggest that in mitigating principal-agent conflicts, size of ownership has an influence.

An important influence on the development of CSR is the role of stock exchange indices on socially responsible companies. These indices can be considered specific tools for adapting this concept in practice, in particular in the field of socially responsible investment. This article provides a comparative analysis of the social, environmental and governance criteria underlying the definition of the composition of selected European SRI indices. The research will cover the following indices: the DJSI Europe Index, the FTSE4Good Europe 40, the FTSE4Good Europe 50, the EURO STOXX Sustainability 40 and the Solactive Sustainability Index Europe. This paper also intends to set an index reflecting the degree to which companies of certain European countries are represented in major European SRI indices. Consequently, global and national initiatives and ratings were excluded, as well as sector- and industry-specific initiatives and ratings. The proposed index is standardized by introducing the GDP of each country into the calculation formula as a way to a achieve comparable result. We believe that the proposed metric will reflect the state of the art in SRI and provide an overall picture of SRI practices across nations. © 2018 Magdalena Mikołajek-Gocejna, published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {Purpose -The purpose of this chapter is to explore the proactive role played by investor relations officers (IROs) in enhancing the quality and delivery of corporate social performance (CSP) information to social responsibility investment (SRI) analysts and investors, thereby improving the link between CSP and corporate financial performance (CFP). The increasing pressures on corporations to produce and communicate CSP information will be described, as well as how the timely and meaningful communication of CSP can improve CFP. Methodology/approach -Subsequent to a review of relevant literature, three case examples from McDonald's, Nestle, and Stora Enso illustrate Hockerts and Moir's grounded theory framework that suggest how IROs can improve communication of CSP. Findings -This chapter illustrates three levels of communicating CSP information. First, IROs target SRI investors and respond to ESG inquiries and surveys. At the second level, IROs integrate ESG information into business strategy and finacial results. At the third level, IROs actively market CSP and create a two-way proactive dialogue between SRI investors and senior management and the board. Practical implications -This chapter provides practical examples to improve ESG activities and their communication via the IRO to SRI analysts and investors. Originality/value of chapter -This chapter contributes to the literature on the CSP-CFP link by illustrating how proactive IROs are improving the CSP information channel to SRI securities analysts and investors. Furthermore, it advances the theory and research concerning the impact of the information channel between IROs and securities analysts behind the CSP-CFP link.

In this study, we test the integration of social performance measures (companies the most virtuous or high-rated in terms of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues) in Islamic portfolios using KLD social ratings. We seek to determine the financial price of complying both to Islamic investment and SRI principles. To do so, we measure the financial performance of self-composed Islamic portfolios with varying ESG scores. The results indicate no adverse effects on returns due to the application of ESG screens on shariah-compliant stocks during the 2007–2011 periods while reporting substantially higher performance for the portfolios with good records in governance, products, diversity, and environment issues. On the opposite, a negative performance is associated with an SRI strategy of disengagement from shariah-compliant stocks with community and human rights controversies. Our performance measures are controlled for market sensitivity, investment style, momentum factor, and sector exposure. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

Reducing investors’ information symmetry and agency costs is the mechanism by which better ESG transparency potentially impacts firm value. Using Bloomberg ESG disclosure scores to assess a firm's ESG transparency, we look at a sample of 1996 large cap companies across 47 developed and emerging countries and territories. Our empirical analyses suggest that the benefits from ESG disclosure outweigh their costs for the average listed firm. We find supporting evidence for greater disclosure of ESG issues boosting firm valuation measures, such as Tobin's Q. Furthermore, our results suggest that firms with greater asset size, better liquidity, higher R&D intensity, fewer insider holdings and good past financial performance will be more transparent in ESG issues.

To address this question, we match daily i-spreads of green-labeled and similar non-green-labeled bonds and look at their pricing differentials. We find that rating classes AA–BBB of green bonds as well as the full sample trade marginally tighter for the respective period compared to non-green bonds of the same issuers. Furthermore, financial and corporate green bonds trade tighter than their comparable non-green bonds, and government-related bonds on the other hand trade marginally wider.

The databases are US government on-line listings of fines for environmental breaches, unsafe workplaces, fraudulent accounting standards, and product recalls. These measures are assumed to proxy for signals to stakeholders of the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks in transacting with the firm and appear to have fewer biases than conventional measures of stakeholder standards. Using a sample of all non-financial S&P 500 firms during the most recent 1998-2003 full cycle in the market, after controlling for firm-specific differences, sales margins of firms fell by 0.8% if they announced a product recall and by 0.4% if cited by OSHA for an unsafe workplace; and shareholder return was significantly reduced by an EPA or SEC prosecution. This study links the risk of transaction uncertainty, information signaling theory, and the resource-based view of the firm to company financial performance. Results support the normative assumption that a firm's sales margin will be damaged by unethical treatment of stakeholders as evidenced by ESG breaches, presumably because risk-averse customers and suppliers are alert to signals of counterparty risk. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and financial performance (FP) has bourgeoned widespread debate among researchers. In recent years, the debate has explored more dynamic links, one of which is the curvilinear relationship, between CSR and FP. This paper aims to empirically test the curvilinear relationship between CSR and FP in the context of Indian companies. Design/methodology/approach: This paper empirically tests the curvilinear relationship between CSR and FP in the context of Indian companies. The study used a panel data of 43 listed companies over a period of ten years from 2008 to 2017. A correlation and panel regression were carried out to examine the possible link. Findings: The findings demonstrate that a curvilinear relationship exists between CSR and FP, suggesting that two long competing viewpoints may be complementary. Research limitations/implications: The study mainly focuses on top companies, so the generalizations of results to other small companies are unwanted. Practical implications: An immediate managerial implication of the findings suggests that to serve the interests of the shareholders, a long-run planning and considerable resources should be dedicated at this direction, given that CSR expenditure does not pay off immediately. Originality/value: In the Indian context, very few studies have analyzed the linkages between CSR and FP. Using an improved and distinctive approach, the study empirically tests the relationship between CSR and FP from non-linear perspective. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose - There is growing recognition that numerous business drivers contribute to financial performance and investment returns but they are not included in a company's profit and loss statements. In the investment industry, these wider sets of value drivers are known as environment-socialgovernance (ESG) factors. A small number of specialized ESG rating agencies provide information to investors about the extent to which firms' behaviors are socially responsible. However, a major criticism of these rating agencies is the lack of transparency in their methods. This paper aims to examine the issues of subjectivity, transparency and uniformity of ESG ratings by exploring the methods used to assess ethics performance by an Australian rating agency. Design/methodology/approach - A case study was conducted on an Australian ESG rating provider, Regnan. The data for the analysis were sourced from internal Regnan documents. Findings - The paper found that a level of subjectivity is inevitable in ESG ratings and the call for uniformity may inhibit innovation, but these issues can be addressed by increased transparency of the rating methods. Research limitations/implications - Further research is required to understand what level and, combination of, uniformity and transparency is sufficient to satisfy stakeholder requirements for ESG information. Practical implications - The discussion of the factors underlying the ethics performance rating may prompt more open and transparent debate on how to assess ethical performance of companies, and increase investor confidence in ESG ratings. It may also provide more direction to companies on how to strengthen their ethical performance. Originality/value - There is growing recognition that numerous business drivers contribute to financial performance and investment returns but they are not included in a company's profit and loss statements. These "ESG" factors can account for up to 66 percent of the market value of globally listed companies. In response to calls for more transparency on how ESG factors are assessed, and how ethical performance is appraised, this paper attempts to lift the veil on ESG rating methods. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Corporations and large entities are increasingly disclosing material information on their financial and non-financial capitals in integrated reports (IR). The rationale behind their IR is to improve their legitimacy with institutions and stakeholders, as they are expected to communicate on all aspects of their value-creating activities, business models and strategic priorities. In this light, the purpose of this paper is to trace the theoretical underpinnings that have led to the organizations’ environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures, and explain the purpose of integrated thinking and reporting. Design/methodology/approach: Following a review of relevant theories in business and society literature, this contribution examines the latest developments in corporate communication. This research explores the GRI’s latest Sustainability Reporting Standards as it sheds light on IIRC’s <IR> framework. Afterwards, it investigates the costs and benefits of using IR as a vehicle for the corporate disclosures on financial and non-financial performance. Findings: This contribution sheds light on the latest developments that have led to the emergence of the organizations’ integrated thinking and reporting as they include financial and non-financial capitals in their annual disclosures. The findings suggest that the investors and the other financial stakeholders remain the key stakeholders of many organizations; it explains that they still represent the primary recipients of the corporate reports. However, the integrated disclosures are also helping practitioners to improve their organizational stewardship and to reinforce their legitimacy with institutions and other stakeholders in society, as they embed ESG information in their IR. Research limitations/implications: IIRC’s <IR> framework has its inherent limitations that are duly pointed out in this paper. However, despite its weaknesses, this contribution maintains that its guided principles and content elements could support those organizations that may be willing to voluntarily disclose their non-financial performance in their corporate reports. Practical implications: This paper has discussed about the inherent limitations of the accounting, reporting and auditing of the organizations’ integrated disclosures. It pointed out that the practitioners may risk focusing their attention on the form of their reports, rather than on the content of their IR. Moreover, this contribution implies that the report preparers (and their stakeholders) would benefit if their IR is scrutinized and assured by independent, externally recognized audit firms. Originality/value: This contribution has addressed a gap in academic literature along two lines of investigation. First, it linked key theoretical underpinnings on the agency, stewardship, institutional and legitimacy theories, with the latest developments in corporate communication. Second, it critically evaluated the regulatory instruments, including: GRI’s Sustainability Reporting Standards and the <IR> framework, among others; as these institutions are supporting organizations in their integrated thinking and reporting. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper examines the impact of access to finance and environmental financing on the financial performance of the banking sector globally. Based on cross-sectional linear regressions and non-linear threshold regressions of 713 banks from 75 countries over the period 2013–2015, we find that access to finance has significantly positive effects on banks’ financial performance in most estimation models controlling for both bank-specific and macroeconomic variables. The positive impact on financial performance is channeled through loan growth and management quality. We find that for banks with total assets less than USD 2 billion, access to finance has a significantly positive impact on return to equity.

	abstract = {This paper presents the results of a multidisciplinary qualitative study concerning the influence of investors on the performance and dependencies of companies in relation to biodiversity and natural capital (BNC). For BNC, we employ four indicators: land use, water use, chemical pollution and carbon emissions. The study assesses: (i) in which way asset managers and fund managers exert influence on the efforts of companies to reduce their negative environmental impact and to improve their positive environmental impact; (ii) how this influence is perceived by the companies; and (iii) to what extent legislation requiring reporting on non-financial performance criteria supports the parties in their engagement and communication. Interviews were conducted with multiple investors and companies to assess in a detailed way the interaction between these parties. Key findings include that BNC is considered material by half of all interviewed investors, that they employ available legal options in their engagement strategies, and that they use the information disclosed by investee companies pursuant to mandatory reporting law. However, company respondents indicate that investors are only interested in BNC when it is clearly and directly linked to (reduced) financial risks. These respondents stated that BNC performance as well as transparency strategies do not have any material influence on investors. Another central issue flagged by respondents is the lack of comparable and standardised information regarding BNC themes such as corporate water use, land use and chemicals. Common methodologies and standards to tackle these issues are still missing. Based on our findings, it can be concluded that tangible strategies for successfully tackling BNC issues are absent. The approaches developed so far are not clearly enough linked to (financial) risks and opportunities in the past, present or future. The perceived effect of EU Directive 2014/95 on tackling BNC issues is also low and environmental profit & loss accounts are unable to clarify the financial relevance of BNC. Establishment of a clear nexus between BNC and financial risks and opportunities is a necessary precondition to advance BNC in future. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Present actions of the company have an influence on its long-term success as well as on the well-being of the society, ecosystem and environment. Sustainable investing is gaining critical attention world-wide. This study aims to empirically test whether corporate sustainability (CS) has an impact on market value. The relationship is examined using the panel data of Indian non-financial firms from 2010 to 2015 that are consistently ranked by Thomson Reuters ASSET4 database. Taking market value as proxy for firm value, a significant positive relationship is found between CS and market value. We find evidence to support firms that employ sustainable strategies in business policy formulations are better rewarded by investors with higher valuations in capital markets. This study provides empirical support for the stakeholder theory as is perceived by the proponents of ethical business practices. It suggests that businesses that seek capital market appreciation can likely achieve it by aligning corporate virtue of profit to ESG which helps to build social reputation and brand for the firm.

	abstract = {Abstract: The past few decades have seen a marked increase in socially responsible investing (SRI), an investment strategy that incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in the decision-making process. While there has been substantial investment and research in predominantly advanced economies, we have seen striking growth in key Asian markets in recent years, suggesting broader proliferation of more responsible corporate and investment practices. Because socially responsible investors take both financial and social considerations into account when allocating investments, this raises questions about the viability of SRI as an investment strategy and motivations behind individuals and institutions engaging in it. To investigate this further, this study analyses the emergence of the SRI market in South Korea given very public corporate governance concerns following the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s and recent visibility of SRI investments by the country’s largest institutional investor, the National Pension Service (NPS). This study contributes to corporate governance and new institutionalist theory by highlighting that the need to address gaps in corporate governance has served as an important motivation for investment and research institutions to enhance socially responsible investments in Korea. Supported by anecdotal evidence from leading members of the local SRI community, this study suggests that while we have seen the primacy and evolution of existing institutions in the SRI market, SRI growth has been buttressed by the emergence of new institutions, such as research organizations and the Korean Sustainability Investing Forum, and reinforcement by international institutions in the form of the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, global indexes and international CSR guidelines. As such, this study provides a more nuanced understanding of SRI’s emergence in Korea by highlighting institutional layering and dynamics that have led to changes in the local market while eschewing the idea that the emergence of SRI was simply the result of a deliberate effort to ‘westernize’ institutions. Indeed, in Korea’s case, while SRI is a borrowed concept, its primary function has been to address corporate governance issues rather than to generate superior financial returns. In addition to theory-building, findings also highlight practical implications, including opportunities for more rigorous corporate social performance analysis and investment advisory, greater market coordination and awareness-building, and the need to monitor corporate social performance and financial performance going forward. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Researchers in developed countries argue that banks should be free to decide about their sustainability initiatives without the interference from regulators. However, researchers in developing countries tend to think differently. This study aimed to focus on this argument by examining the linkage between sustainability and financial performance (SFP) aided through regulatory policy guidelines. In doing so, a comparative study was conducted between 2012 and 2018 to compare the pre-and post-status of SFP due to implementation of policy measures. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores were calculated and related with financial performance (return on assets) through regression analysis. The sample data includes 30 private commercial banks (PCBs) in Bangladesh. The analysis of the data shows that during these years, the overall sustainability performance, i.e., environmental, social and governance scores of the banks increased by 33 percent. However, the transformation of this performance into better financial performance could not been established even when age and size were taken into account. The current turbulent state of the banking sector due to growing non-performing loan has been identified as the single most influential factor for this neutral result. Research findings suggest that policy guideline initiatives do have a positive impact on bank sustainability. However, exogenous factors, such as political interference, may appease, deviate and prolong its impact on financial performance. This work will enhance the understanding of academics and policy-makers about the feasibility and impact of the policy-led sustainability model in the banking sector, particularly in developing countries. © 2019 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

Environmental disclosure score was found to have significant inverse relationship with measures of both accounting performance (ROA) and marketing performance (Tobin's Q). Social performance disclosure has significant positive impact on firms' financial performance. Size of the firm has moderating role to play in determining the impact of social disclosure score on financial performance. Larger firms were found to be displaying higher capability to convert their social performance into competitive advantage.

	abstract = {Background: By focusing on sustainable financial and environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) returns, companies and investors can do well by doing good. Despite growing interest in sustainable corporate practices, limited ESG-related research has been conducted in South Africa. Previous researchers have mainly focused on corporate governance. All three ESG aspects should, however, be addressed to ensure corporate sustainability. It is possible that the consideration of a composite ESG measure can conceal varying levels of consistency in the individual aspects. Aim: The main objective was to investigate the relationship between ESG and corporate financial performance (CFP) measures. Setting: Firms listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange between 2011 and 2016. A total of 66 firms were considered from six sectors. Methods: Data for the sample (359 firm-year observations) were analysed by conducting panel regressions. In line with international research, ESG was considered as the independent variable, while eight measures of CFP were individually considered as the dependent variables. Composite and individual ESG disclosure scores were obtained from Bloomberg. The respective accounting-based, market-based and value-based CFP measures were sourced from IRESS. Results: Two main trends emerged from this study. The majority of the significant relationships identified between variables were only observed: (1) once the composite ESG disclosure score was disaggregated and (2) when a distinction was made among sectors. Conclusion: The empirical evidence suggests that ESG aspects are not homogeneous across sectors. Firm leaders should hence employ a differentiated approach to address the most important risks relevant to their operating environments. © 2019. The Authors.},

Call for investigations on mediators and moderators have been put on notice to provide further explanations of previous mixed findings. This study responds to the calls for research by investigating the mediation effect of CSR outcomes, on the relationship between CSR governance and financial performance. We extract CSR governance and outcomes data from the Bloomberg environmental, social and governance (ESG) database and financial performance data from the COMPUSTAT database. Using a sample of 1980 firm-year observations from the top 500 Green companies in the United States for the years 2009 through 2013, we find that CSR outcomes mediate the relationships between CSR governance and financial performance. The results suggest that whether companies implement CSR governance successfully to generate good CSR outcomes plays an important role influencing companies' financial performance. The results of our study contribute to the CSR literature by providing an explanation of the mediation effects of actual CSR outcomes to the previous heterogeneous findings on CSR-financial return relationships. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Corporate sustainability implies a compromise between the present environmental, social, and economic needs of a firm's stakeholders and their future needs. Corporate sustainability is therefore a multidimensional concept. Nowadays, several independent rating agencies rate firms in terms of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. These ratings are usually used by main sustainability indices such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, FTSE4 Good, Stoxx Sustainability Index, or Euronext Vigeo Family to select companies to invest in. Only those firms performing better than the average of their sector are selected. However, although providing linguistic ratings about the performance of the firms in individual ESG criteria with respect to their sector, rating agencies do not usually provide overall ESG rates describing the global performance of the firms in terms of ESG. In this paper, we propose a flexible operator, linguistic ordered weighted geometric aggregating operator (LOWGA), which will allow us to define the fuzzy ESG performance of the firms based on the linguistic labels provided by the rating agencies. Once overall ESG scores have been obtained, we will use them together with financial criteria to rank the firms in terms of their sustainability using a suitable multiple criteria decision aid (MCDA) approach, namely, TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution). © 2017 The Authors.

A theoretical model of satisfaction with SRI-profiled mutual funds is developed and tested. The results indicate that perceived financial performance of the SRI-profiled mutual fund is the most important predictor of customer satisfaction. However, perceived environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance also had a positive impact on satisfaction for the SRI mutual fund. On the basis of these results, it is argued that although ESG quality is important to customers, marketers of SRI initiatives should primarily focus on the conventional quality attributes such as financial performance, as a good ESG record alone is unlikely to generate customer satisfaction. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

Financial performance is measured via a range of financial ratios. The paper finds that a majority of the publiclylisted construction companies studied have low levels of reporting, while construction companies issuing nonfinancial reports largely outperform those which do not in a number of selected financial ratios, although the correlation between financial performance and ESG scores is not strong.

This study, motivated by the increasing awareness of various stakeholders about the importance of ESG disclosure, explores the impacts of ESG on firm efficiency of government-linked companies (GLCs) in Malaysia from 2006 to 2012. The ESG disclosure is based on the Sustainalytics ESG Research data available in Bloomberg while data development analysis (DEA) is used to estimate firm efficiency. This study found that GLCs focused more on governance disclosures, followed by social and environmental aspects. Governance improved firm efficiency, but social and environmental factors had no similar effects. In conclusion, this study provided insight on ESG initiatives which are useful for stakeholders when making financial and investment decisions. © 2017 Institutions and Economies All rights reserved.},

This brings several implications to corporates' strategy as well as development of socially responsible investments (SRI). To facilitate the development of SRI, companies should communicate the value and returns of these initiatives clearly with investors; financial institutions should also equip investors with knowledge to understand non-financial information.

Top 100 largest companies listed each in Bursa Malaysia and Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen are selected. Content analysis on companies' annual report and stand-alone reports produced in 2013 is carried out using a modified ESG disclosure index based on prior studies and established global standards. A one year lag consideration is used on firm's performance. A significant difference was found on the ESG disclosure level between countries and different ESG element is being emphasized by each countries. However, the finding was not as expected, even though legislative pressure does exist in Denmark, it fail to prove that disclosure in Denmark is higher or more comprehensive than Malaysia, a country without any specific requisite on ESG. No association was found between ESG disclosure level and firm's financial performance. This study provides the evidence that there is significant influence of the country's regulatory background on the firm's ESG disclosure level. This has an important implication for Bursa Malaysia's policy with the recent introduction of FTSE4Good ESG Index in Dec 2014 by the stock exchange that would be an advantage for Malaysian market to attract the social responsible investors around the world.},

The relationship between the extent of CSR disclosure and its determinants was examined using multiple linear regression analysis incorporating 133 companies listed in S&P Composite 1500 Index for the year 2011. The results illustrate that the company's size, GHG emissions, DJSI and anti-bribery policy are significantly positively associated with the extent of CSR disclosure.

A correlation and regression analysis was carried out to evaluate possible links between ESGP as determined by the Asset4 database of Thomson Reuters and accounting and market-based measures of FINP (Return on Assets [ROA] and Tobin’s Q). Findings: ESGP has a positive impact on ROA but no impact on Tobin’s Q. Furthermore, by analyzing the three different components of ESGP, governance performance has the strongest impact on FINP in comparison to environmental and social performance. Originality/value: The analysis makes a key contribution to the empirical corporate social responsibility (CSR) research as the author breaks down ESGP into their three components and include both accounting-based and market-based FINP measures for the German setting for the first time.

Whether or not we condition the analysis on the occurrence of the 2008–2009 financial crisis, we do not observe clear-cut changes over time.

Specifically, this study examined the impact of corporate sustainability reporting on the financial performance of Oil and Gas companies in Nigeria. This work contains a review of relevant literature, hinging the topic on stakeholder theory. Cross-sectional research design was utilized in undertaking the study. A sample of six (6) companies were selected from the oil and gas sector of public limited liability companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange and studied from 2012 to 2017 financial years. Secondary data were gathered for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosures by content analysis of corporate reports. Secondary data were also gathered to measure company performance by computing Return on equity ratio from the financial statements of the selected companies. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Findings revealed a positive relationship between sustainability disclosure and financial performance.

	abstract = {The world has great expectations for how the private sector, both companies and investors, can support the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In fact, it is generally believed that these goals cannot be achieved without strong support from the private sector. But will making the world a better place hurt financial returns? The answer is "No" if companies focus on the SDGs and their associated targets that benefit from strong performance on the material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues that matter to investors. In this paper we map the 30 generic ESG issues identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) to the SDGs and their targets. We show that some SASB issues are more material for a given SDG than others. We also show that some SASB issues are more important to the SDGs in general than others. We also map the material ESG issues for each of SASB's 79 industries to the SDGs and to their targets. For each sector, there are particular SDGs where it has high impact and for each SDG there are particular sectors that have a high impact on it, and some sectors are more important to the SDGs in aggregate than others. The same is true at the target level. This mapping can be used as a guide for both companies and investors who want to understand how value-creating ESG performance can contribute to the SDGs. This paper is divided into four parts. Part I explains the motivation for this study. Part II explains our methodology and Part III the results. Part IV concludes with a summary of our results and some reflections on how our mapping methodology can be improved. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Findings: If SRI is about making a change toward sustainability, we ought to study its societal and environmental impacts. Although scholar articles on SRI have gained importance in the two last decades, very little is known on its impact. Research has developed from a narrow concern with negative screening and divestment in isolated cases to a rigorous analysis of its financial performance across a range of ethical and ESG issues. While we have identified some studies that are beginning to explore the potential impact of SRI for society, this remains a crucial area to explore.; Originality/value of the chapter: The chapter contributes to the debates on the societal impact of SRI, a debate that needs to be continued even if or just because it raises some fundamental questions that are complex and difficult but also necessary to advance SRI.; Purpose: The objective of this chapter is twofold. It first introduces the theme of the book. There are many ways of looking at socially responsible investment (SRI). It can be viewed as a financial product where the financial performance is the outmost important aspect and cannot be compromised. Or it can be regarded as a force for change to promote and stimulate a more sustainable development. In this chapter we provide a literature review on SRI especially on the notion of the impact and how it has been addressed so far in the literature. The second objective of the chapter is to provide an overview of the volume by introducing each chapter.; Methodology: This chapter reviews the literature on SRI as well as the chapters included in this volume.

The study entails an analysis of ESG performance in sensitive industries (i.e., those subject to systematic social taboos, moral debates, and political pressures and those that are more likely to cause social and environmental damage). To test our hypotheses, we applied linear regressions with a data panel using the Thomson Reuters Eikon™ database to analyze data from 365 listed companies selected from BRICS between 2010 and 2012. The results suggest that companies in sensitive industries present superior environmental performance, even when controlling for the firm's size and country.

Our aim is to analyse the impact that CSR disclosure, as a transparency mechanism, and good CG practices have on the financial performance of socially responsible companies. To this aim, a system of simultaneous equations is proposed, in which the CSR disclosure variable has a mediating role, acting as liaison between the CG adopted by the organisation and the financial valuation.

The traditional view of corporation expects a negative relationship, while the stakeholder theory expects a positive one. Research design, data, and methodology - We adopt the ESG score, published by Korean Corporate Governance Service to measure the level of socially responsible activity for the Korean retail firms. The ordinary least square method is adopted to investigate this relationship. The publicly traded retail firms are examined from 2011 to 2016. Results - We find that the total ESG score is negatively related to ROE but shows no statistically significant relationship with ROA and Tobin's Q value. However, a firm's environmental score is negatively related with both of ROE and ROA. Its social score is no conclusive relationship with the performance measures. The governance score is negatively related to the value of Tobin's Q. Conclusions - This paper generally supports the traditional view of corporate theory, especially in terms of ROE. This evidence is not well aligned with the existing study for Korean corporations generally documenting positive relationships. We find almost no empirical evidence supporting the stakeholder theory of corporation in the Korean retail industry. © 2013 NRF.},

Scholars and investors have published more than 2000 empirical studies and several review studies on this relation since then. The largest previous review study analyzes just a fraction of existing primary studies, making findings difficult to generalize. Thus, knowledge on the financial effects of ESG criteria remains fragmented. To overcome this shortcoming, this study extracts all provided primary and secondary data of previous academic review studies. Through doing this, the study combines the findings of about 2200 individual studies. Hence, this study is by far the most exhaustive overview of academic research on this topic and allows for generalizable statements. The results show that the business case for ESG investing is empirically very well founded. Roughly 90% of studies find a nonnegative ESG–CFP relation. More importantly, the large majority of studies reports positive findings. We highlight that the positive ESG impact on CFP appears stable over time. Promising results are obtained when differentiating for portfolio and nonportfolio studies, regions, and young asset classes for ESG investing such as emerging markets, corporate bonds, and green real estate. © 2015, © 2015 The Author(s).

After discussing theories that explain the ESG performance of firms such as institutional theory, accountability and stakeholder theory we present uni- and multivariate statistical analyses of ESG reporting and its relation to environmental and financial performance. Our results suggest that ownership status and membership of certain stock exchanges influence the frequency of ESG disclosure. In turn, ESG reporting influences both environmental and financial performance.

The sample used includes ESG data of ASSET4, Bloomberg and KLD for the U.S. market from 1991 to 2012. The econometrical framework applies an ESG portfolio approach using the Carhart (1997) four-factor model as well as cross-sectional Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions. Previous empirical research indicates a relationship between ESG ratings and returns. As against this, the ESG portfolios do not state a significant return difference between companies with high and low ESG ratings. Although the Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions reveal a significant influence of several ESG variables, investors are hardly able to exploit this relationship. The magnitude and direction of the impact are substantially dependent on the rating provider, the company sample and the particular subperiod. The results suggest that investors should no longer expect abnormal returns by trading a difference portfolio of high and low rated firms with regard to ESG aspects. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

(2007) observed that “the mechanisms connecting prior corporate financial performance (CFP) to subsequent CSP” is an important issue for further investigation. In this study, we examine whether different states of cash flow liquidity impact the extent of a firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. If firms perform well in CSP, we assume they have greater cash flow liquidity as measured by the KZ index and Altman's Z-score. We posit that firm engagement in CSR is negatively linked with financial constraint dummies, which are computed as above 20% on the KZ index, or an Altman's Z-score below 1.81. In this study, we compute the ratio of CSR strengths to concerns for each firm, which allows us to assign a specific CSR ‘Focus’ for each sample firm. Based on data from MSCI ESG STATS ratings, all firms are divided into seven focuses: an Environment Focus (ENV), a Community (COM) Focus, an Employee (EMP) Focus, a Diversity (DIV) Focus, a Product (PRO) Focus, a Governance (CGOV) Focus and a Human Rights (HUM) Focus. Furthermore, a multiple logit regression is conducted based on these seven focuses to examine the impact of financial constraints/liquidity proxies on firms with different CSR focuses. Our results confirm a significant negative association between CSR activities and the degree of financial constraints/distress. Our finding confirms the view of Campbell (2007). For the CSR focuses, we find that in general firms facing financial constraints do not engage in any CSR activities, especially when the degree of financial constraints is assessed by the KZ index. Our findings are robust using various CSR measures and financial constraint measures, and potentially useful to market participants when making investment decisions. Our findings also provide greater understanding of the characteristics of CSR firms. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

Specifically, the risk-adjusted financial performance of 103 socially responsible bond funds in the US and the Eurozone is compared with a matched sample of conventional funds. During the period 2001-2014, socially responsible bond funds outperform by one-half of one percent annually. An evaluation of fund holdings and a performance-attribution analysis suggest that this outperformance is directly related to the mitigation of ESG risks, which is achieved by the exclusion of corporate bond issuers with poor corporate social responsibility activities. A separation of crisis and non-crisis periods further indicates that the outperformance is especially likely to occur during recessions or bear market periods. We confirm this crisis-related return effect from a sample of socially screened bond indices. Moreover, our results are robust to alternative definitions of sustainability, survivorship bias, fund characteristics and stable in the US and Eurozone sub-samples. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Diversity of BoD in terms of gender diversity, CSR committees, board average, and independent directors are examined as to their influence on voluntary ESG disclosure. This rating is highly relevant to managers and investors considering ESG issues in their decision-making process. The factors that drive or hinder ESG disclosure are gaining importance. Despite the relevance of the topic, in Italy there is a scarce amount of literature regarding diversity in the BoD. The data set includes ESG data for more than 54 Italian companies for the period 2011–2014. The results indicate that firm's CSR disclosure is associated with independent director and committee CSR. In addition, women on BoDs is negatively correlated while the age of the board is not significant. Based on this study, shareholders and policymakers will have a deeper knowledge on the significant roles that board diversity is playing as a determinant of ESG disclosure.

	abstract = {A huge body of research has addressed the impact of corporate social performance (CSP) on corporate financial performance. However, prior literature provides only limited evidence of the impact of CSP on firm risk. The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of CSP operationalized by environmental, social, and governance factors on market-based firm risk in Europe. Three risk measures are analyzed: systematic, idiosyncratic, and total risk. On the basis of a large European panel dataset of 8752 firm-year observations covering the period 2002–2014, we find that a higher CSP decreases total and idiosyncratic risk. Looking at the three dimensions of CSP, we show that social performance has a significantly negative effect on all three risk measures. Environmental performance generally decreases idiosyncratic risk, whereas total risk and systematic risk are only affected in environmentally sensitive industries. In contrast, we cannot detect a significant effect of corporate governance performance on firm risk. Our findings suggest that a higher CSP and a higher performance regarding the social dimension in particular have the potential to increase firm value through lower firm risk. Overall, our evidence fosters the assumption that there is a business case to be made for corporate social responsibility. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Purpose -Responsible investor (RI) engagement seeks to change corporate strategic priorities while balancing the financial imperative. This chapter uses an institutional theory framework to explore the tension between financial performance and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in RI engagement. Methodology -Discourse of the proponent, supporters and opponents of Australia's first climate change shareholder resolution -a minority proposal, will be analyzed using framing analysis. Findings -Framing indicated that the discourse emphasized the dominant financial performance logic while often omitting the ESG logic. One possible explanation is that the process of shareholder proposalnomination and the financial imperative of investment organizations effectively co-opted the engagement. Research limitations -A case of responsible investment engagement is used to illustrate multiple logics in the investment field. Although there are significant limitations to drawing inferences from a single example, the discussion is relevant to RI support for engagement initiatives such as the UN Principles of Responsible Investment clearinghouse and Carbon Disclosure Project Carbon Action. This chapter argues that attempts to change corporate strategic actions on climate change by RI through engagement will be less effective while the financial performance logic provides relatively more legitimacy to investors. Practical implications -Integrating the ESG logic with the financial logic is vulnerable to co-optation due to incommensurability. Operationalizing both logics requires establishing a boundary between ESG and financial logics to develop legitimacy. Social implications -RI engagement on climate change has the potential to be an important part of the social response to the sustainability agenda. Originality -In applying institutional theory to RI climate change activism this chapter presents original insights into the potential of engagement to effect change.

	abstract = {Institutional investors and corporations increasingly recognize that extra-financial determinants of business performance can both create value and uncover significant risks within a business or investment portfolio. For companies that invest in, develop, own, or operate commercial real estate assets, this awareness of extrafinancial impacts has led to a significant interest in what has been called responsible property investment (RPI). Within the field of RPI, green real estate - real estate investment and management that seeks to reduce the environmental impacts of building construction and operations - has begun to receive attention. This attention has been extended over the past decade to community property development projects, where both social and environmental considerations related not only to the building, but also the project site and surrounding community are integrated into management and investment decisions. Some examples of these projects include affordable and workforce housing, urban revitalization and brownfield redevelopment. More social-focussed issues such as labour and workplace considerations are also key components of responsible property investing, yet to date labour issues have received little attention in the RPI literature and workplace considerations are reflected indirectly through environmental considerations in the green building literature. This paper explores responsible real estate investment in Canada by taking an integrated approach in examining both environmental and social factors and their potential impact on such investments. A series of semi-structured interviews are conducted with key stakeholders in Canada to gain insight into how using environmental and social factors may influence long-term risk and financial returns in real estate investment in Canada with particular emphasis on institutional investors engaged in these practices. Data is used to analyse the impact that ESG considerations have on financial performance of these assets. Jantzi-Sustainalytics ESG ratings are used along with the stock price changes of fourteen real estate companies and REITs to interrogate this question. © Springer 2010.},

	abstract = {Public listed companies in Malaysia have been pressured tremendously to accept the engagement of Environment, Social and Governance (ESG), but the engagement is still low based on previous studies. ESG will enhance company financial performance, image as well as the ability to attract and retain the workplace which contributes to the market value in the economy. This shows that ESG engagement improve company brand image and reputation, increase customer loyalty and sales as well as productivity. Corporate governance is seen to be the key role to ensure that companies engage with ESG practices since it can enhance the value creation and improve financial performance. Even the present investors are bound to look for non-financial performance elements like corporate governance and environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices that the company engaged since it is an evidence of effective corporate governance. Based on today's global and innovation-driven economy which also include social and environmental matters consisting of welfare distribution and growth, it is said that countries need to be more efficient in finding new ways to enhance the environmental policy promoting greater change and dynamics. Thus, they must find new ways to develop an innovation policy to emphasise the knowledge-driven economy on the capacity to adapt and adopt best practices, create, diffuse and transform innovation and knowledge. The absorptive capacity will recognise the ability of the individual and company in adopting the innovation which play an essential part in determining the characteristics of good corporate governance to ensure best ESG practices in the company. This paper examines the relationship between board capabilities and ESG practices through the mediating role of absorptive capacity. Board size, board diversity and board independent are the board capabilities that the paper investigates. Collection of information and data was from company's listed in FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia from the year 2012 to 2016. The results from the regression analysis show that ESG practices have a significant relationship with board size, board diversity, board independence and absorptive capacity. On top of that, absorptive capacity is perceived to have influence on board diversity and board independence towards ESG practices. The results provide empirical evidence and guidance in identifying areas of problems in the current policy and amend it for a better policy in promoting sustainability. © Sciedu Press.},

	abstract = {Prior research on the association between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) includes conflicting perspectives and inconclusive findings as to whether or not CSP has a positive, negative, or neutral association with CFP. While Wang's (2015) meta-analysis confirms the relationship between CSP and CFP to be significant and positive, in some contexts CSP and CFP associate negatively; CSP may need to receive "good management" support to yield positive financial outcomes (Luo & Bhattacharya, 2009). The study here tests and supports the perspective that "good management" occurs in configurations (i.e., business models) with high CSP to indicate high CFP. A configurational theoretical stance implies that recipes of bad management with high or low CSP are likely to associate with low CFP. Configurational analysis supports this theoretical perspective. Building from complexity theory, a configurational analysis includes the propositions that complex multiple recipes lead to the same outcome (equifinality tenet) whereby variables (ingredients) found to associate causally in one configuration may be absent in another recipe or even inversely related in a third recipe associated with this same outcome. The present study employs a mixed methods research design (using surveys of senior executives, independent CSP firm assessments using ESG factors (environment, social (or human rights), and governance), and analysis of corporate annual reports of 82 mostly highly-global Swedish firms). The study overcomes the mismatch between case-level theory proposals and variable-based data analyses that is widespread in the relevant literature. The study's findings support the core tenets of complexity theory. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose-The chapter aims to analyse the challenges needed in order to achieve the full integration of corporate reporting. Approach-As a viewpoint chapter, both theoretical and practical problems are presented. Findings-On the theoretical side, there is still an elusive relationship between environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators and financial performance. Conceptual models are still in the making and a global standard has not yet been achieved. Besides, as each company may have different CSR strategies, it might be difficult to achieve comparability among firms. On the practical side, there might be concerns about materiality of data (what actually merits to be informed) and the potential risks for disclosing additional information to the market. Social implications-While the linkage between non-financial and financial results is not yet standard practice, it should be encouraged by stakeholders. The impact of integrated reporting is probably not going to be limited to investors an financial markets, as other stakeholders would have the opportunity to act on the information provided by these documents. Originality/value-Integrated reporting is still a concept that is being developed. Thus, this chapter aims to contribute to this ongoing academic and practical debate.

	abstract = {Social and environmental ratings provided by social rating agencies are multidimensional. The first goal of our paper is to identify a small number of independent and relevant socially responsible (SR) dimensions reflecting a firms' coherent posture toward social issues. We put forward that these dimensions are not exactly the same as the ESG ones (Environment, Social, and Governance). Using the six sub-ratings provided by the Vigeo rating agency, we perform a principal component analysis and we highlight three main independent SR dimensions related to (1) business stakeholders (employees, customers, and suppliers), (2) societal stakeholders (environment and society), and (3) financial stakeholders (stockholders and debt holders). The second objective of our paper is to explore the link between stock returns and these three SR dimensions. Our most notable finding is that for each SR dimension, investors ask for an additional risk premium when they accept to hold non-socially responsible stocks. The cost of equity is thus lower for SR firms. The average premium over the period 2003-2010 is larger for the components "business stakeholders" and "financial stakeholders" than for the component "societal stakeholders." The premium for this last component has only existed since the end of 2008. Since that time, environment and community involvement have become important risk factors strongly considered by investors. For the three dimensions, investors notably penalize large non-social firms and reward small social firms. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},
