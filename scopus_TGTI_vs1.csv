Recently, investors increasingly concentrate on the ethical impact of their investments in addition to financial rewards. The present study outlines links between a company’s ESG practices and its financial performance. By means of performance comparison between the Nifty 100 ESG and Nifty 100 Indices within the Indian context, it is suggested that investing in ESG-adopting companies can lead to better financial performance. The study uses statistical analysis to compare the performance of both indices between 2018 and 2022. The analysis includes financial ratios, such as P/E ratio, ROA, ROE, and ROCE. The findings reveal a relatively modest connection between ESG and P/E ratio. The stronger negative correlations between ESG and key financial metrics (ROA, ROE, and ROCE), signifies a more robust trade-off between ESG focus and financial performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","ESG; Financial performance; Nifty 100 ESG index; Nifty 100 index; P/E ratio; ROA; ROCE; ROE","","","","","","","","Boiral D., Heras-Saizarbitoria S., Mishra P., The role of sustainability reporting in corporate legitimacy: A meta-analytic review, J.

The collaboration network analysis has revealed trans-regional and geographical cooperation patterns in global ESG financial performance research, especially close collaboration between European and South American countries. In terms of publishing institutions, Bucharest Univ Econ Studies and Univ Craiova are tied for the highest number of publications, while Kyushu Univ and Univ Portsmouth lead in academic influence. The co-occurrence timeline analysis of keywords has exposed hot topics and trends in ESG research, such as”sustainable investing,””ESG performance,” and”corporate social responsibility.” This study provides a macroscopic understanding of the field of ESG financial performance, aiding in the identification of research frontiers and future directions, and promoting the accumulation of knowledge and theoretical development. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Bibliometrics; ESG; ESG Financial Performance; Visualization Analysis","Bibliographies; Economic and social effects; Investments; Bibliometric; Bucharest; Collaboration network; Environmental, social, and governance; Environmental, social, and governance financial performance; Financial performance; Performance research; Systematic analysis; Visualization analysis; Web of Science; Decentralized finance","","","","","","","Hui Z., Qunhui H., A Bibliometric Analysis of Research Hotspots and Frontiers in ESG Responsible Investment [J], Science of Science and Management of Science and Technology, 43, 12, pp. 57-75, (2022); Yuan H., Pengcheng L., Jie Y., Bibliometric Analysis of Research on Green Finance Standardization [J], Standard Science, 1, pp. 4-13, (2024); Yuke L., Comparative Study of ESG Rating Agencies [J], Business Observation, 10, 9, (2024); Daugaard D., Emerging new themes in environmental, social and governance investing: a systematic literature review [J], Accounting and finance, 60, 2, pp. 1501-1530, (2020); Drempetic S., Klein C., Zwergel B., The influence of firm size on the ESG score: corporate sustainability ratings under review [J], Journal of business ethics, 167, 2, pp. 333-360, (2020); Jizi M.I., Salama A., Dixon R., Et al., Corporate governance and corporate social responsibility disclosure: evidence from the US banking sector [J], Journal of business ethics, 125, pp. 601-615, (2014); Bourveau T., Brochet F., Garel A., The capital market consequences of tenure-based voting rights: evidence from the Florange Act [J], Management science, 68, 12, pp. 9107-9128, (2022); Landau A., Rochell J., Klein C., Et al., Integrated reporting of environmental, social, and governance and financial data: does the market value integrated reports?

This study uses a sample of non-financial listed companies from 2000 to 2020 and applies the staggered difference-in-differences technique to eliminate the endogeneity problem. Findings show that ESG disclosure has a favorable effect on corporate financial performance. This conclusion remains robust after a series of robustness tests, including the parallel trend test, Goodman-Bacon decomposition, replacement of dependent variables, system GMM estimate, the placebo test, etc. ESG disclosure has heterogeneous effects on financial performance. The positive effect of ESG disclosure on corporate financial performance is more pronounced in companies with ESG investors and companies with longer inception, high media attention, and high agency costs. In addition, investors with ESG preferences exert a substantial moderating effect on the link between ESG disclosure and financial performance connection. We arrive at two conclusions in the extended analysis. One is that ESG disclosure attracts ESG investors. Another is that ESG investors also play a positive moderating role in the connection between ESG ratings and financial performance. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","ESG; Financial performance; Goodman-Bacon decomposition; Investor preference; Staggered difference-in-differences method","","","","","","Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs for Doctoral Students of Jinan University, (2021CXB025); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, (2021B1515020103); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","We thank the support provided by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China [Grant No. 2021B1515020103 ] and the Outstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded Programs for Doctoral Students of Jinan University [Grant No. 2021CXB025 ].","Abdi Y., Li X., Camara-Turull X., Exploring the impact of sustainability (ESG) disclosure on firm value and financial performance (FP) in airline industry: The moderating role of size and age, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 24, 4, pp. 5052-5079, (2022); Angrist J.D., Pischke J.S., Mostly harmless econometrics, Mostly harmless econometrics, (2008); Aouadi A., Marsat S., Do ESG controversies matter for firm value?

We collected sample data on KOSPI-listed companies in 2021 using ESG ratings released by the Korea Corporate Governance Service. The system of ratings was segmented into three distinct categories for the purpose of analysis, namely the environment, society, and governance. An empirical investigation was conducted to determine how ESG ratings and separate ratings (E, S, and G ratings) affect financial performance. We also examined the moderating impact of the debt ratio on the association between ESG ratings and financial performance to enhance the explanatory strength of this relationship. The results indicated that ESG ratings and E and S ratings are positively related to financial performance, and the debt ratio has a negative moderating effect on the link between ESG ratings related to environmental aspects and financial performance. The findings indicate that firms need ESG management to improve financial performance. ESG ratings can be utilized to show the effects of environment-focused management, sustainability, and CSR initiatives on financial performance. Additionally, the moderation effect of the debt ratio in this study clearly demonstrates the connection between ESG rating and financial performance. Our analysis also demonstrates that organizations with high debt ratios and a lack of resources to pursue ESG are unable to devote a significant amount of time and resources to ESG management. © 2024 Conscientia Beam.

Most recent sample of 351 firms from FTSE350 for the time period 2002–2018 is used. The study estimates the impact of total ESG and individual dimensions of ESG on corporate financial performance using static and dynamic panel data techniques, and it also examines the impact of high and low ESG on firm financial performance. Further, the study investigates the role of firm size as a moderator in the relationship between ESG and firm financial performance. The results of total ESG performance indicate that ESG has a positive and significant impact on firm financial performance. However, in the case of the individual ESG performance, the results are mixed. Overall, the results confirm that high ESG firms show high financial performance as compared to low ESG firms. Results indicate that firm size moderates the relationship between ESG performance and firm financial performance. © 2021 The Author(s).

The analysis focuses on key financial metrics, including Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio, and Tobin’s Q. The results indicate a significant positive relationship between ESG disclosure scores and both ROA and ROE, suggesting that transparent ESG reporting enhances organisational efficiency and financial outcomes. These findings align with Freeman’s Stakeholder Theory (1984) and earlier studies of Kumari et al. (2022), which posits that engaging stakeholders through transparent ESG disclosures improves financial results. The results carry important implications for both corporate managers and investors. For managers, the positive association between ESG disclosure scores and financial performance highlights the importance of transparency in ESG reporting. While ESG controversies may not have immediate financial effects for investors, they could harm long-term financial performance and corporate reputation. By examining the dual role of ESG disclosure and controversy scores, this study seeks to provide valuable insights for corporate managers and investors, emphasising the critical importance of transparency and ethical conduct in enhancing organisational trust and financial outcomes. © 2025, University of Wollongong.

For the data of a-share companies from 2010 to 2020, a multiple linear regression equation was constructed to test the impact of ESG performance on corporate financial performance. Although enterprises have spent huge costs in the process of ESG practice to fulfill their social responsibilities, they need to strengthen their links with stakeholders, improve their management level, practice environmental protection, and enable enterprises to gain a competitive advantage, thereby improving their ability to create value. The results showed that ESG performance was positively correlated with corporate financial performance.

Whereas the ultimate goal of ESG responsibilities is non-financial matters, that is, to incorporate socially acceptable norms into business activities to reach sustainable goals for society. Employing an unbalance panel data model for listed companies in Indonesian Stock Exchange from 2016 to 2022, this study provides empirical evidence on the indirect impact of ESG implementation on firms’ non-financial performance. Consistent with the stakeholder theory, this study found a positive impact of ESG implementation on firm values. The predictability of ESG performance in future financial performance is in line with the resource-based views. ESG-related financial performance has a positive impact on non-financial performance. Firms are willing to increase their commitment to ESG activities if these activities can primarily improve their financial performance. The regulatory policy with dual materiality characteristic is effective in mitigating the mere financial motives of ESG implementation to the more substantive outcomes on ESG-related issues.

Empirical evidence shows a positive association between a firm's SASB ESG Score and financial performance, along with a negative link to financial risks. In contrast, the ESG Disclosure Score fails to predict a firm's financial performance and risks. Furthermore, the effect of the SASB ESG Score on profit is associated with higher market competitiveness and greater operational efficiency. On the other hand, the risk reduction is associated with the mitigation of stock price crash risks. The piecewise linear regression analysis suggests that superior SASB ESG Scores are linked to enhanced financial performance and reduced financial risks. We attribute the findings to the efficient allocation of resources toward ESG activities that hold material significance within a firm's specific industry. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.","CSR; ESG disclosure score; Financial performance; Financial risk; Material issues; SASB ESG score","","","","","","College of Commerce; Financial Research Center; National Chengchi University, NCCU; National Science and Technology Council, NSTC, (112-2410-H-004-116-MY3)","We are grateful to the editor and anonymous referees for their insightful and helpful comments.

This study examines whether financial performance shortfalls motivate firms to undertake improved ESG practices, possibly to maintain future legitimacy. It also investigates whether ESG controversies mediate firms’ ESG decisions in such situations. It finds a strong positive influence of financial performance shortfall on firm's ESG performance. However, when such firms are constrained by high levels of ESG controversies, they are less likely to engage in higher ESG practices, although such controversies have positive mediating impact on the relationship between financial performance shortfalls and ESG performance. © 2021","Aspiration level; Environmental; ESG controversy; Financial performance shortfall; Social and governance performance","","","","","","","","Albuquerque R., Koskinen Y., Zhang C., Corporate social responsibility and firm risk: theory and empirical evidence, Manag.
