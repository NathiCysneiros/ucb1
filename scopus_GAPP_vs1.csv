The paper offers a unique view into a situation where information or lack thereof has played a key part in corporate governance, exploring the relationship between management and the board of directors and how information filtering can go wrong to the extent that vital information does not reach the board. The paper is based on a case study of the illegal collaboration of the oil companies. It furthermore surveys the literature on information flow and information asymmetry for explanations of what happened in the case of the Icelandic oil companies.

Two of these mechanisms include the board of directors and takeover defenses. The purpose of this paper is to show that rather than having an additive effect, the marginal benefit of using one of these mechanisms declines as the use of the other increases. Design/methodology/approach - Using a governance index that measures the firm's takeover defenses and a unique board of directors index, the study employs both univariate analyses and multivariate simultaneous equation modeling in order to test the hypotheses. Findings - The results of these tests show that these two measures of corporate governance should be viewed as a set rather than as individual components. In other words, a strong board is inversely related to strong shareholder protection in the form of takeover defenses. The study further analyzes the extent to which growth opportunities influence this relationship using a logistic regression approach. It appears that a firm's opportunity for growth is related to the strength of its board of directors, yet not to its governance provisions. Originality/value - By analyzing a specific combination of current corporate governance practices, these results can assist firms at a practical level by providing information on optimal solutions to the agency problem. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Board of Directors; Corporate governance; Take-overs","","","","","","","","Barnhart S., Spivey M., Alexander J., Do firm and state anti-takeover provisions affect how well CEOs earn their pay?, Managerial and Decision Economics, 21, 8, pp. 315-28, (2000); Baysinger B., Butler H., Corporate governance and the board of directors: Performance effects of changes in board composition, Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 1, 1, pp. 101-24, (1985); Beasley M., Board of director composition and financial statement fraud, The Accounting Review, 71, 4, pp. 443-66, (1996); Borokhovich K., Brunarski K., Parrino R., CEO contracting and anti-takeover amendments, Journal of Finance, 52, 4, pp. 1495-517, (1997); Carter D., Simkins B., Simpson W., Corporate governance, board diversity, and firm value, Financial Review, 38, 1, pp. 33-53, (2003); Chava S., Dierker M., Livdan D., Do Shareholder Rights Affect the Cost of Bank Loans?, (2004); Core J., Holthausen R., Larcker D., Corporate governance, chief executive officer compensation, and firm performance, Journal of Financial Economics, 51, 3, pp. 371-406, (1999); Deangelo H., Rice E., Anti-takeover charter amendments and stockholder wealth, Journal of Financial Economics, 11, 14, pp. 329-59, (1983); Gillan S., Hartzell J., Starks L., Industries, Investment Opportunities, and Corporate Governance Structures, (2002); Gompers P., Ishii J., Metrick A., Corporate governance and equity prices, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118, 1, pp. 107-55, (2003); Goyal V., Lehn K., Racic S., Growth opportunities and corporate debt policy: The case of the US defense industry, Journal of Financial Economics, 64, 1, pp. 35-59, (2002); Jarrell G., Poulsen A., Shark repellents and stock prices: The effects of anti-takeover amendments since 1980, Journal of Financial Economics, 19, 1, pp. 127-68, (1987); Jensen M., Agency costs and free cash flows, corporate finance and takeovers, American Economic Review, 76, 2, pp. 323-9, (1986); Jensen M., The modern industrial revolution, exit, and the failure of internal control systems, Journal of Finance, 48, 3, pp. 831-80, (1993); Johnson M., Rao R., The impact of anti-takeover amendments on corporate financial performance, Financial Review, 32, 4, pp. 659-89, (1997); Lasfer M., Board structure and agency costs, Working Paper, (2002); Linn S., McConnell J., An empirical investigation of the impact of ""anti-takeover"" amendments on common stock prices, Journal of Financial Economics, 11, 14, pp. 361-99, (1983); Lipton M., Lorsch J., A modest proposal for improved corporate governance, Business Lawyer, 59, pp. 59-78, (1992); McWilliams V., Managerial share ownership and the stock price effects of anti-takeover amendment proposals, Journal of Finance, 45, 5, pp. 1627-40, (1990); McWilliams V., Sen N., Board monitoring and anti-takeover amendments, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 32, 4, pp. 491-505, (1997); Malekzadeh A., McWilliams V., Sen N., Implications of CEO structural and ownership powers, board ownership and composition, on the market's reaction to anti-takeover charter amendments, Journal of Applied Business Research, 14, 3, pp. 53-63, (1998); Morck R., Strangeland D., Yeung B., Inherited wealth, corporate control and economic growth: The Canadian disease, Working Paper, (2000); Rosenstein S., Wyatt J., Outside directors, board independence and shareholder wealth, Journal of Financial Economics, 26, 2, pp. 175-91, (1990); Rosenstein S., Wyatt J., Inside directors, board effectiveness, and shareholder wealth, Journal of Financial Economics, 44, 2, pp. 229-50, (1997); Shivdasani A., Yermack D., CEO involvement in the selection of new board members: An empirical analysis, Journal of Finance, 54, 5, pp. 1829-53, (1999); Smith C., Watts R., The investment opportunity set and corporate financing, dividend, and compensation policies, Journal of Financial Economics, 32, 3, pp. 263-92, (1992); Tsui J., Jaggi B., Gul F., CEO determination, growth opportunities, and their impact on audit fees, Journal of Accounting, Auditing, and Finance, 16, 3, pp. 189-208, (2001); Webb E., An examination of socially responsible firms' board structure, Journal of Management and Governance, 8, 3, pp. 255-77, (2004); Yermack D., Higher market valuation of companies with a small board of directors, Journal of Financial Economics, 40, 2, pp. 185-211, (1996)","E.

To achieve the objective of the study, it is necessary to know the effect of the asymmetry of information on the decisions of current and future shareholders and investors, and then to study the effect of the characteristics of the board of directors on the fair value of the share. For this reason, the method of analyzing time-series analysis (Panel Data) has been used, based on a sample of 13 Jordanian commercial banks listed in the Amman Financial Market. The study period is 2015-2019, and four banks were excluded for failing to meet the study conditions. The study was based on two models; the first one aimed to examine the effect of the relationship between asymmetric information and the fair value of the share, while the second model aims to study the relationship between the effect of the characteristics of the Board of Directors on the relationship between asymmetry of information and fair value. It was found that there is a problem of information asymmetry among investors in commercial banks, and the level of asymmetry was different from one bank to another and from year to year. The problem of information asymmetry is caused by the failure to deliver financial information to all parties in a timely manner. The most important recommendations Independent board members should be increased because of their positive impact on the relationship between information asymmetry and fair value, The need to increase the number of females on the boards of directors of Jordanian commercial banks to increase gender diversity and make the decisions of the boards of directors more indicative. © 2020 KIIE","Asymmetry of information; Characteristics of Board of Directors; Fair Value","","","","","","","","Frankel R., Li X., Characteristics of a firm’s information environment and the information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 37, 2, pp. 229-259, (2004); Gujarati D.

The disclosure index was obtained from the relationship between the number of citations of the keywords and the number of pages in the sustainability reports. The analysis was performed using multiple linear regression, considering 740 observations from financial years 2016 and 2017. The results indicate that the size and percentage of external members on the board of directors, Big Four audits, size of the audit committee, and participation of government shareholding positively influence the levels of disclosure of anti-corruption practices. In turn, the presence of politicians on the board of directors leads to an increase in information asymmetry due to a lower level of disclosure, which, by extension, represents less commitment to anti-corruption practices. © 2021.

Furthermore, this study examined the direct and moderating effect of corporate governance devices on this relationship. We apply ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to examine changes in stock liquidity for French-listed firms between the pre-IFRS and the post-IFRS period. We show that IFRS adoption is well-perceived by financial statement users. Following Boubaker et al. (2019), R. and Firoz (2022), Bansal (2023), and Agrawal and Chakraverty (2023), we found that these standards have a positive impact on stock liquidity and a negative impact on information asymmetry. In addition, audit quality has a decisive role in improving information quality. However, contrary to expectations, the independent members of the board of directors do not exercise their role of control and monitoring efficiently. We conclude that the reporting process is influenced by firm-level characteristics, and we contribute to the literature by enhancing discussion on the debate related to the benefits of IFRS adoption. Our findings can be of interest to regulatory bodies and policymakers by providing a better understanding of the factors that influence stock liquidity and decision-making. © 2024 The Authors.","Audit Quality; Board of Directors; Corporate Governance; IFRS; Information Asymmetry; Mandatory Reporting; Stock Liquidity","","","","","","","","Abbassi W., Hunjra A.

Yet, relatively little is known about contemporary challenges non-executive directors face and whether their boards are well-equipped for their new tasks. Based on self-assessment reports by supervisory boards, a survey and interviews with supervisory board members, this paper investigates the challenges non-executive directors face in the Netherlands, particularly after a decade of corporate governance reform. Non-executive directors' inadequate role in scrutinising executive directors' performance, information asymmetries and dysfunctional working relationships between executive and non-executive directors are among the greatest challenges indicated by non-executive directors on Dutch supervisory boards. The paper discusses several implications for scholars and practitioners and provides a unique insight in boardroom dynamics.

Instead of examining the effect of board characteristics in isolation from each other, this study extends previous research on the determinants of IC disclosure by considering board effectiveness score in relation to IC disclosure. Moreover, this study extends previous studies in board-IC disclosure relationship by investigating the hypothesized impact of information asymmetry in moderating this relationship. Our fndings show that IC disclosure is positively associated with the effectiveness of board of directors. In addition, our study provides evidence that the level of information asymmetry in GCC bank moderates the relationship between board effectiveness and IC disclosure. The fnding is important for policymakers as it confrms that the effectiveness of board of directors in protecting the investors depends on the level of information asymmetry.","Banks; Board of Directors;

After controlling for other influences such as the auditor’s reputation, the underwriter’s reputation and the level of information asymmetry, our results lend strong support for the hypothesis of the influence exerted by ownership concentration over the level of IPO underpricing. Moreover, we find a nonlinear relationship between the proportion of shares in the IPO belonging to members of the board of directors and the level of underpricing. Other IPO and firm characteristics such as the size of the offer and its structure also prove to be statistically significant. Finally, we find that the market cycle influences the valuation of IPOs, as the relationship between the market return and the initial IPO return is positive and statistically significant. © 2018 Asociación Española de Contabilidad y Administración de Empresas (AECA).","board of directors; Corporate governance; initial public offerings (IPOs); ownership structure; pricing","","","","","","Spanish Ministry of Economy; Health and Safety Executive, HSE; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (ECO2014-56102-P, ECO2017-84864-P, MINECO-16-ECO2015-66184-R); National Research University Higher School of Economics, ВШЭ; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER; Government Council on Grants, Russian Federation","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful for the helpful comments of an anonymous referee and from participants at the 6th IFABS International Conference held in Lisbon (June, 2014), the XXIV ACEDE Conference, held in Castellón (September, 2014), and the XXII Finance Forum held in Zaragoza (November, 2014).

This study of a sample of Spanish listed companies during the period 2004-2007 provides some evidence about the question. The results suggest that two board attributes - director ownership and board activity - appear to influence in the risk assessment of debtholders because of their ability to reduce agency cost and information asymmetry. We also find a non-linear relationship between board size and cost of debt, suggesting that from certain levels the benefits of large boards may be outweighed by the cost of poorer communication and increased decision-making time. © 2010 Springer.","Board of Directors; corporate governance; cost of debt","","","","","","Spanish Government, (SEJ2007-61450/ECON)","We would like to thank two anonymous referees and the editor for the helpful comments and suggestions received during the review process.
